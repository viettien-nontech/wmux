## Build & Dev

```bash
npm run dev            # Vite (port 5199) + Electron hot-reload
npm run build:main     # tsc main/preload/cli only (fast iteration)
npm run build:renderer # Vite production build (renderer only)
npm run build          # Full: tsc + vite + electron-builder
npm test               # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:watch     # Vitest watch mode
npm run lint           # ESLint src/
```

### Known Build Gotcha

Project lives in `OneDrive - Pulsa` (path with spaces). This breaks:
- `npm link` / `node-gyp` (can't build node-pty)
- `electron-builder` winCodeSign (symlink errors)

**Workaround**: Don't use `electron-builder` for the final package. Use ASAR-based manual packaging (see Release Process below).

### Main Process (`src/main/`)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.ts` | Entry point, AppUserModelId, auto-save (30s), pipe server startup, V2 pipe handlers (workspace/pane/surface/markdown/sidebar/notification) |
| `pty-manager.ts` | PTY lifecycle (create with surfaceId, write, resize, kill) |
| `pty-crash-guard.ts` | Keeps a PTY-side error from killing the whole app (issue #150). Every pane's PTY lives in main, so a throw there takes the window down: wraps node-pty's `_$onProcessExit` (a throw there becomes an unhandled C++ `Napi::Error` in `conpty.node` → `abort()`) and claims each terminal's `error` event (node-pty re-throws socket errors when fewer than 2 listeners exist, and registers none). Installed at module load — after `pty.spawn` is too late |
| `pipe-server.ts` | Named pipe `\\.\pipe\wmux` — V1 text (shell hooks), V2 JSON-RPC (CLI/agents). Every reply is `socket.write(text, () => socket.destroy())`, and the clients (`wmux.ts`, `wmux-hook.ts`) `destroy()` on the first reply chunk — never `end()`. libuv on Windows arms a **50 ms `eof_timeout`** after a half-close on a named pipe (src/win/pipe.c) and only releases the handle on the peer's EOF or on expiry; the server never closed its side, so every CLI verb and every hook process paid the full timer plus slop: `wmux ping` **94 → 33 ms**, a hook process **94 → 32 ms**, against a raw pipe round trip of 1 ms. A server-side `end()` does NOT fix it (both sides arm the same timer, measured 93 ms unchanged), which is why the comment there says destroy and means it. Safe only because every client sends one request per connection — the framing loop still gates the destroy on "no further complete line buffered", pinned by a test |
| `cdp-bridge.ts` | Browser webview control via Chrome DevTools Protocol |
| `cdp-proxy.ts` | CDP WebSocket proxy |
| `agent-browser-cli.ts` | Where `agent-browser` is on this machine, and how to run it. Two traps, both found by running the real binary rather than by reading its docs. (1) **`execFile` never returns.** Its callback fires on stdio CLOSE, not on process exit, and every command that starts the daemon — the first `open` of a session, `dashboard start` — leaves that daemon holding the inherited stdout pipe open for as long as it lives. Measured against 0.35.0: an identical cold `open` had the child exit 0 at **787 ms** while `execFile`'s callback had still not fired at 3 min, so the verb burned its whole timeout and was reported as a FAILURE despite having succeeded. Hence `spawn`, resolving on `'exit'` (the event that actually means "done"), with a 50 ms drain window so output is not truncated — `'close'` lands right behind `'exit'` when nothing holds the pipe, so the wait is only ever paid by the daemon-spawning commands. Anyone "simplifying" this back to `execFile` breaks agent mode completely and silently. (2) **Never a `.cmd`.** Node refuses to spawn `.bat`/`.cmd` without `shell: true` (the CVE-2024-27980 mitigation) and throws a **synchronous** `EINVAL` — in main that is an uncaught throw, not a failed command. `shell: true` is not available as a fix: argv carries agent-controlled URLs and `eval` snippets, and routing them through cmd.exe's parser is the exact trap `powershell-shim.ts` documents (#154). The npm package ships real per-platform binaries under its own `node_modules/agent-browser/bin/`, so resolution targets those first and the shim is never a candidate. Memoised like `node-runtime.ts` (#187) because it is read on the pane path (#176), and keyed on the configured path so a Settings change invalidates without every caller remembering to ask |
| `agent-browser-verbs.ts` | The pure wmux-verb → argv table. I/O-free on purpose: it is the piece most likely to drift as agent-browser's CLI evolves, so it must be exhaustively testable with no daemon, no Chrome, no Electron. Returns an ARRAY, never a joined string — `params` arrive from a pipe command an agent controls. A missing `ref` on `click`/`type`/`fill` throws -32602 rather than putting `undefined` on a command line, and an unknown verb throws the same -32601 the web engine does so a caller cannot tell the engines apart by their error. Also where the **one engine divergence** is recorded in code: `wait` has no per-call timeout in agent-browser, so a caller `ms` sent alongside a ref is unrepresentable in argv and deliberately dropped — see CLI Reference |
| `agent-browser-session.ts` | surfaceId → session name + wmux-allocated stream port. Sessions are **ephemeral** — nothing persisted, no profile dir, a session's process lifetime equals its surface's — and that is what makes orphan handling correct by construction rather than by heuristic: no wmux-owned session can legitimately survive, so any prefixed session with no live surface is garbage. That is the property the #139 post-mortem wanted and did not have. But the registry is in-memory and starts EMPTY, so it is **not ground truth after a crash** — the sessions that actually survived are precisely the ones it cannot see, and reconciliation asks `agent-browser session list` instead. wmux allocates the stream port ITSELF (9300+, above the CDP proxy's 9222-9230) because the dashboard deep-links by `?port=`, and discovering an OS-assigned port after the fact races the webview load; `ensureBindable` verifies each candidate with a real `listen` first, since the registry tracks only what it handed out and never what the OS holds — an orphan from a previous run may still be bound. `isWmuxSessionName` is a security boundary, not tidiness: names come out of a machine-global namespace anyone can write into and go straight back onto a command line as `--session <name> close`, so both the instance prefix AND the full `surf-<uuid>` shape are required. `WMUX_INSTANCE` gets its own prefix — a side-by-side wmux is exactly as much "not us" as a human's hand-made session |
| `agent-browser-daemon.ts` | The observability dashboard, refcounted by live agent-mode surfaces: first acquire starts it, last release stops it. **Adopt, never fight** — if :4848 already answers, a human or another wmux started it, so wmux uses it, records `adopted`, and NEVER stops it: not on the last release, not on shutdown. `adopted` is a getter with deliberately no setter, since anything that could write it could make teardown kill a dashboard wmux does not own. A failed `acquire()` rolls back its own increment (clamped — `refs` must never go negative) so a phantom ref cannot strand a dashboard no later release can reach zero on, and `release()`/`shutdown()` wait out an in-flight start before deciding there is nothing to stop — otherwise a start that settles just after shutdown leaks a child process that outlives wmux entirely |
| `agent-browser-runtime.ts` | The single home for the singletons — exactly one `SessionRegistry`, exactly one `DashboardDaemon` — plus the impure halves the pure modules take by injection. A second copy silently corrupts both: two registries hand 9300 to two surfaces, two daemons each believe they own the dashboard and the first `release()` to hit zero stops it out from under the other. It also owns the **per-surface** dashboard reference, because two paths take one for the SAME surface (the renderer enabling agent mode, and a `wmux browser` verb arriving for that pane) and when each kept its own Set the pane took two references and gave back one, so the dashboard outlived every agent pane until quit. Readiness is the PORT, never the exit: `dashboard start` exits at 58 ms having daemonised while :4848 does not accept a connection for ~500 ms, and in some configurations it does not exit at all. `reconcileOrphanSessions` runs at startup off `session list` because a crash reaches none of the other teardown paths and Windows reparents rather than kills (#139); a `close` that hangs (observed after a daemon version-mismatch restart) is deadlined and left for the next launch rather than resolved by killing a PID — agent-browser exposes no per-session PID and its daemon fronts several sessions, so leaking one Chrome beats killing somebody else's browser |
| `agent-manager.ts` | Agent PTY spawning, round-robin distribution across panes. The agent command travels as a `startupCommands` entry that the PowerShell integration runs during init (see `pty-manager.ts`), not as keystrokes typed after a sniffed prompt: the prompt regex stopped matching the moment #207 wrapped the prompt in OSC 133 marks, so every `wmux agent spawn` silently fell into the 1500 ms debounce (first output 1.71 s → 0.56 s). The sniffing path survives for shells without the integration, with `looksLikePrompt` tolerating trailing OSC/CSI sequences |
| `window-manager.ts` | Electron BrowserWindow creation/management |
| `ipc-handlers.ts` | All IPC channel handlers |
| `claude-context.ts` | Injects wmux instructions into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, configures hooks, installs wmux-orchestrator plugin — **and the inverse of each**, since 0.40.0. The per-tool-call hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit) are written with `async: true`: they are pure observers, and Claude Code waited a measured 125-145 ms on each of them on the critical path of every tool call. Ordering is already handled — every report carries the wall-clock it fired at and `agent-state.ts` drops anything older than what it accepted (#151). SessionStart, Stop and SessionEnd stay sync. `applyWmuxHooks` rewrites its own entries on every launch, so an install that predates the flag picks it up without a migration |
| `agent-integration.ts` | Consent gate for every write outside `%APPDATA%\wmux` (issue #132). Asks on first launch, stores `unset`/`granted`/`declined` in wmux's own settings.json, and reconciles `~/.claude` + `~/.config/opencode` + `~/.kiro` to match. Nothing in `claude-context.ts`, `opencode-context.ts` or `kiro-context.ts` may be called directly from startup any more — route it through here |
| `kiro-context.ts` | Kiro CLI support (issue #148). Writes `~/.kiro/steering/wmux.md` — a dedicated global steering file, since Kiro loads every `.md` in that dir, so there is no shared file to splice into. No hooks: Kiro's are per-project (`.kiro/hooks/`), and writing into every repo the user opens is the #132 mistake. State comes from `wmux report-agent` instead |
| `opencode-context.ts` | Installs `resources/opencode-plugin/wmux.js` into `~/.config/opencode/plugin/`, gated on the `// wmux-plugin-version:` marker (`pluginNeedsUpdate` compares it verbatim, so any change to the plugin needs a bump or it reaches nobody — every broken install already has the old file on disk). **That plugin file must export `WmuxPlugin` and nothing else** (#191): OpenCode's auto-discovery loader calls EVERY export as a plugin factory and then invokes a `config` hook on the result, so an exported helper returning a plain value crashes OpenCode at startup. Helpers hang off `WmuxPlugin.__wmuxInternals` for the tests; a source-level test pins the export count |
| `claude-observer.ts` | Monitors Claude Code activity for sidebar display |
| `claude-resume.ts` | `claude --resume` on workspace restore (#186), behind `workspacePrefs.restoreClaudeSessions` (**default off** — every such pane starts an agent at once). Stamps each terminal's live session id into the PERSISTED tree only, the way `freezeSurfaceCwds` stamps cwd; a live surface never carries one. Main-side rather than renderer-side because the id lives in `agent-state.ts`'s record map. The id reaches a command line, so `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID_RE` is a security boundary, enforced at `reportAgentSession` AND again in `claude-resume-command.ts` (session.json is user-editable). `handleHookEvent` must skip `SessionEnd`: it carries a session_id like every hook, but `releaseAgent()` has just run for it, and recording there would resume a Claude the user deliberately quit |
| `agent-state.ts` | Declared agent run state — blocked/working/idle, run refcount, `seq` dedupe, metadata TTL (issue #128). Also the back-channel: declared `choices` + `answerAgent`. **Answering never clears `blocked`** — the agent must confirm, or a mis-declared key silently stops a stuck pane asking for help |
| `agent-state-rpc.ts` | `pane.report_agent` & friends, routed off the main V2 switch |
| `agent-hook-bridge.ts` | Claude Code hooks → declared state, so it works with no plugin to install |
| `quit-sequence.ts` | When quit may let the process leave (#214). The `0xc0000409` aborts reported there are **shutdown** crashes: all six land on a `will-quit` line in the reporter's own `main.log`, to the second, and `logDiagnostic('will-quit', …)` is that handler's first statement. Six across thirteen quits at PTY counts 2–7 — a race, not the file explorer it was filed against. The mechanism is the one the `session-end` comment in `index.ts` already describes: `killAll()` fires N node-pty ConPTY exit callbacks and the process then walks into Node's environment teardown, where a napi call that loses throws off the top of the stack into `__fastfail(7)`. `pty-crash-guard.ts` closes the route where the *JS* callback throws and cannot close this one, because JS is never reached. Two moves: **drain** (hold the quit ~250 ms so the callbacks land while the environment is healthy — the strategy `session-end` argues for, applied to the ordinary quit), then **leave hard** (`app.exit()`, so whatever did not land never sees the teardown). A quit with **no** PTYs defers nothing and exits normally: the hard exit skips Chromium's own shutdown, so it is a treatment for a condition and not a new way of quitting. Pure, because `will-quit` needs a real Electron app to reach and the part worth pinning is the decision |
| `changelog.ts` | Release notes in the app (#211). GETs `/releases` and caches every success under `%APPDATA%\wmux\cache` — inside wmux's own dir, so no part of the #132 consent gate. Every failure falls back to that cache, including a **manual Refresh**: a refresh that fails must not blank the list being read. No `Authorization` header ever; the moment this could carry a token it becomes a thing that can leak one. `toChangelogEntries` is pure and is where everything that can be wrong lives — drafts dropped, a `body` that is `null` rather than absent, a `name` that is `''` on a bare-tag release (so `??` keeps the wrong thing), and ORDER: the API returns releases by CREATION date, which stops being version order the moment a patch for an older line ships after a newer minor |
| `session-persistence.ts` | Auto-save/restore window state. `saveSession` is atomic in the sense the comment always claimed and the code did not (#214): it used to `unlink` the live `session.json` before renaming the temp over it, a window with no session file at all — die there and the next launch has nothing to restore, comes up as a fresh Session 1, and re-mints every pane and surface id, which is that issue's "surfaces come back with new ids and lose their customTitle". The unlink was never needed: libuv's `uv_fs_rename` uses `MoveFileExW` with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`, so a plain `renameSync` over an existing file is legal. It survives only as a fallback for a real sharing violation (antivirus, a sync client), where not saving at all is worse than a brief window |
| `port-scanner.ts` | Active port detection for running dev servers |
| `powershell-shim.ts` | The `wmux.ps1` gate (issue #154). PowerShell resolves a .ps1 ahead of every PATHEXT entry, which is how cmd.exe's argument parser is kept out of the PowerShell path — but a .ps1 PowerShell refuses (Restricted policy, or Mark of the Web under RemoteSigned) is a hard error with NO fallback to the .cmd beside it. So the shim dir goes on PATH only after a probe script in that same dir has actually run in every installed host |
| `node-runtime.ts` | Which binary on this machine can run a `.js` file (#187). Everything wmux hands an agent is "a script plus something to run it", and every consumer had been assuming `node` was on PATH or that the host process was itself a JS runtime — false under OpenCode, whose `process.execPath` is a compiled `opencode.exe`. Resolved once (memoised: it is read on the synchronous pane-create path, see #176) and declared as `WMUX_NODE`. The last resort is wmux's own Electron binary, which is Node under `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, so the chain never dead-ends — but that flag is what makes it a runtime instead of a second wmux window, hence the separate `WMUX_NODE_ELECTRON` signal |
| `ssh-argv.ts` | Parses an ssh command line into the facts scp needs to reach the same host (#195). Pure, and the single funnel for all three detection sources so they cannot disagree about what a command line means. Returning **null is the safe outcome** — a mis-parse does not fail loudly, it uploads a file to the wrong host — so port forwards (`-N`/`-W`), one-shot remote commands and `RequestTTY=no` all abandon the parse rather than guess |
| `ssh-detect.ts` | Is this surface sitting inside ssh, and where? Three layers: **managed** (`wmux ssh` put the command line in the shell spec), **reported** (shell-integration preexec hook), **probed** (`Win32_Process` ancestry sweep). The precedence rule is a security boundary, not a preference: Windows has no tty foreground process group, so a descendant `ssh.exe` may be a *background* process — the probe may only corroborate an authoritative layer, never establish one. `refresh()` short-circuits with no sweep when neither authoritative layer has an entry, because it runs on the paste path |
| `remote-upload.ts` | scp/ssh argv construction and the transfer itself. `BatchMode=yes` throughout: these run with no TTY, so a passphrase prompt would hang to the timeout. All-or-nothing — a failed batch deletes its private `/tmp/wmux-drop-<uuid>/` before returning, since half a batch gives the user remote paths and silence with no way to tell which is which |
| `remote-insert.ts` | What a paste or drop types into a terminal. Lives in main because every input to the decision does (clipboard, detector, filesystem, scp, config). Quoting is per-side: Windows-conditional locally, always single-quoted for a remote sh |
| `win32-process.ts` | One `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` invocation for both the orphan reaper and the ssh probe. Shared so the security-relevant part — resolving `powershell.exe` by ABSOLUTE path, so a writeable PATH dir cannot shadow it — is stated once |
| `system32.ts` | Absolute paths to Windows-owned tools. `opensshPath()` prefers Program Files OpenSSH over System32 (#193): Git for Windows puts an MSYS2 ssh ahead of System32 on PATH, and it cannot talk to the Windows named-pipe ssh-agent — so a bare `ssh` spec died on "Permission denied (publickey)" wherever keys live only in an agent |
| `shell-context-menu.ts` | "Open in wmux" Explorer verb — HKCU shell keys for Directory/Directory\Background/Drive, plus `directoryFromArgv` for the launch path. Win11 places it under "Show more options"; the modern menu needs a signed MSIX, which unsigned wmux cannot ship |
| `theme-loader.ts` | Theme loading |
| `explorer-fs.ts` | The file explorer's jailed directory enumeration, and the path policy every explorer and code read goes through. `resolveInRoot` is the security boundary: the renderer sends a surfaceId and a RELATIVE path and NEVER an absolute one, because a renderer-supplied root would not be a jail — a compromised renderer would simply pass `C:\`. Containment is `path.relative`, plus a Windows-spelling prefix check beside it (the root is realpath'd on the way in, so 8.3 short names and junction aliases are already gone). Two traps live here: `rel.startsWith('..')` also rejects a legitimately-named `..foo`, which the user sees as a folder that silently refuses to open; and a drive root ALREADY ends in a separator, so appending one unconditionally spells `c:\\` and locks a pane at `C:\` out of every folder below it. The walk lstats EVERY segment rather than only the leaf — `root\link\sub` follows `link` before a leaf-only lstat ever runs, and libuv maps reparse points onto symlinks so `mklink /J` junctions are covered by the same check |
| `explorer-roots.ts` | surfaceId → the explorer root for that pane. The root is the pane's TERMINAL cwd, not its active surface's — a pane showing a markdown tab still belongs to the folder its shell is in — and it is normalized through `trustedWindowsCwd`, so a Git Bash `/c/Users/...` report and a PowerShell junction alias both land on the same spelling main can jail against |
| `code-file.ts` | Which files the code viewer will read **and write**, and how. Sibling to `markdown-file.ts`, and it deliberately neither imports from it nor changes it: markdown's extension whitelist stays exactly as narrow as it is, for exactly the callers it already has. The threat model is INVERTED — markdown names its whitelist as the thing stopping a renderer bug from reading `~/.ssh/id_rsa` into a visible pane, and this module has no whitelist at all because the whole point is to read the files that whitelist rejects. What replaces it is `explorer-fs.ts`'s path jail, applied by the `code:read-file` handler before anything here runs. `BINARY_EXT` and the content sniff are a UX filter — they keep `.png` out of the tree and mojibake out of the pane — and a future reader who treats them as the boundary will draw the wrong conclusion about what may be relaxed. `writeCodeFile` adds two things a naive save gets wrong and that both show up as a whole-file rewrite in the next commit: a `<textarea>` normalizes its value to **LF**, so a CRLF file's endings are restored from what is on disk, and the file's **encoding** (UTF-8, UTF-8+BOM, UTF-16LE) is probed from the preamble of the file being overwritten rather than round-tripped through the renderer. The size cap is measured on the ENCODED buffer — UTF-16 doubles most source text, so a string check lets a file through at twice the limit the read side then refuses to reopen |
| `file-grants.ts` | Which paths a renderer may write to — the single gate for every renderer→disk write, checked by both `markdown:save-file` and `code:write-file`. Was `markdown-grants.ts`; renamed when the code surface became editable, because it was always a generic `Map<webContentsId, Set<path>>` and two grant sets would be two answers to "may this be written", whose drift shows up as a silent write to a file one of them would have refused. **Records a partial reversal of #210**, deliberately: that PR refused a jailed read that mints a grant on the grounds that "jailed to a pane root" is not consent, which was right while the pane was read-only. The editor's transaction is different — the user clicks a row, types, presses Ctrl+S — so the rule is now "a write lands only on a path opened into a live pane in THIS window, in this session, through the jail, and only if it has not changed on disk since". Still not a grant source: `markdown:read-file`, which takes a renderer-supplied ABSOLUTE path; a renderer that can mint its own grants makes the set meaningless. That is why the jailed markdown read had to be a separate channel rather than a flag on the existing one |
| `config-loader.ts` | WT/Ghostty config import. Reachable from Settings → Terminal → Import. WT spells opacity two ways — modern `opacity` (0-100, independent of `useAcrylic`) and pre-1.12 `acrylicOpacity` (0-1, only with `useAcrylic`) |
| `shell-detector.ts` | Available shells detection |
| `updater.ts` | Auto-update. Routes by install layout: NSIS → `electron-updater`, portable zip → `zip-updater.ts` (#184). `initAutoUpdater()` returns before registering `NsisUpdater` on a zip extract, so a portable install can never enter the #96 "update ready" loop |
| `zip-updater.ts` | In-place update for portable zip extracts (#184). Detection is the whole contract: `wmux.exe` present, `Uninstall wmux.exe` absent — that name is electron-builder's `Uninstall ${productFilename}.exe`, so it moves if `productName`/`executableName` ever change. Download via `net.request`, extract via System32 `tar.exe` (PowerShell `Expand-Archive` fallback), then a detached cmd helper waits on the old PID and robocopies over the install root. The helper's relaunch is **unconditional** — wmux has already quit, so bailing out on a copy failure is the one outcome the user can't recover from |

### Renderer (`src/renderer/`)

**Components** (in `components/`):
- `SplitPane/` — PaneWrapper, SplitContainer, SplitDivider, SurfaceTabBar
- `Terminal/` — TerminalPane, FindBar, CopyMode, NotificationRing, PinnedPrompt, PromptOutline, NewOutputPill (the three prompt-log OVERLAYS, #207 — all `position: absolute` over the xterm container, never flow siblings: a flow sibling is pushed out of the container's `height:100%` box WITHOUT firing the ResizeObserver, so the PTY keeps its old row count and the bottom rows hide underneath, which is issue #82). Also `PromptsPane` — the outline as a `prompts` SURFACE rather than an overlay, and the one file here the #82 warning does NOT apply to, because it owns its whole box instead of floating over somebody else's. It is the same prompt log seen from elsewhere in the split tree, so unlike the overlay it has to be TOLD which terminal it lists: `promptSourceSurface` (the last terminal to hold focus, written by App.tsx) unless a `promptPaneLocks` entry pins it. Focus landing on a non-terminal deliberately does not update that, or clicking into the panel would blank the list the user just clicked on
- `Browser/` — BrowserPane, AddressBar, AgentBrowserSetup (the `not-installed` vs `no-dashboard` cards — two genuinely different situations, never one card: the second means the agent browser works fine and only its optional viewer is missing)
- `Sidebar/` — Sidebar, WorkspaceRow, SessionMenu, SidebarResizeHandle
- `Titlebar/` — Titlebar, NotificationBell, NotificationPanel
- `Settings/` — SettingsWindow + per-category panels. `ChangelogSettings` (#211) is the "read the release notes without googling wmux" tab, and is mounted only while selected so opening Settings for a font change never fires a GitHub request. Its notes go through the SAME `renderMarkdown` as MarkdownPane — that function is where DOMPurify runs, and this is the one place in wmux where the markdown came off the network
- `CommandPalette/` — CommandPalette
- `Markdown/` — MarkdownPane
- `Tutorial/` — Tutorial
- `Explorer/` — ExplorerPanel, ExplorerTree, plus the pure halves kept out of the component so they are testable without a DOM: `explorer-state.ts` (tree/expansion/per-root cache), `explorer-keynav.ts`, `explorer-errors.ts`, `open-preview.ts` (the preview-tab state machine) and `explorer-diff.ts` (the `+N/-N` rollup and agent attribution). `use-explorer-diff.ts` is the impure half of that last one — fetching, the poll and the hook subscription. The rollup is a FLAT map keyed on POSIX rel-paths covering every changed file **and every ancestor directory**, precisely because the tree lists directories lazily: a rollup that could only see loaded rows would report `src/ +12/-3` because that is the part the user happened to have expanded. The poll runs only while the panel is open AND the window is focused, and hook events (not the timer) are the primary freshness signal — `diff-provider` coalesces per-cwd, but coalescing bounds the damage of a fast poll rather than making one correct (#141)
- `Code/` — CodePane, the file view with a line-numbered gutter, editable since 2.7.0. Its header used to say read-only was a property of the component's SHAPE rather than a flag; that is rewritten rather than left to mislead. The editor is a plain `<textarea>` — **not** CodeMirror or Monaco, which roughly doubles a renderer bundle already at ~1.8 MB to serve "edit a thing or two". `draft === null` IS the read-only mode, rather than a boolean beside the text that can disagree with it. Edit mode drops the line-number gutter on purpose: keeping numbers aligned against a textarea means matching its font metrics, padding, scroll position and wrapping exactly, and any drift points the numbers at the wrong lines

**Hooks** (in `hooks/`):
- `useTerminal.ts` — xterm.js lifecycle, PTY connection, OSC notifications, WebGL renderer, OSC 133 prompt marks (#207)
- `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` — 54+ shortcut actions, safe interception

**Pipe Bridge** (`pipe-bridge.ts`):
- Exposes Zustand store operations as `window.__wmux_*` globals
- Called by main process via `executeJavaScript` to bridge V2 pipe commands to renderer
- Covers: workspace CRUD, pane split/close/list, surface CRUD, markdown content, notifications,
  browser engine get/set (`__wmux_getBrowserEngine` / `__wmux_setBrowserEngine` — the split tree
  lives in the store and main has no copy, so main asks the renderer before routing any
  `browser.*` verb. An unknown surface answers `web`, which is the safe answer, not a lazy one)

**Store** (Zustand, in `store/`):
- `workspace-slice.ts` — Workspace CRUD, split tree updates
- `surface-slice.ts` — Surface/tab add/close/move/navigate
- `settings-slice.ts` — Shortcuts, sidebar prefs, theme
- `notification-slice.ts` — Notification lifecycle (max 200)
- `agent-slice.ts` — Agent metadata tracking
- `prompt-slice.ts` — Per-surface prompt log (#207). Bounded twice: 200 prompts per surface, 64 surfaces. **Only the facts** — a marker is a live emulator object and lives in `utils/prompt-marks.ts` instead. `line: null` means "not jumpable"; a view must never read it as line 0
- `prompt-actions.ts` — The three prompt commands as functions of a surface id, because there are two callers (the shortcut table and the command palette) and they were about to disagree. The palette hands every action it does not recognise to a `console.log`, so an action wired only into the keyboard table appears in the palette, is selectable, and silently does nothing
- `split-utils.ts` — Immutable split tree helpers, plus `buildWorkspaceTree(panes, layout)` (#212): what a NEW workspace opens as. That shape used to be hard-coded in two places that disagreed — the sidebar `+` built a three-pane T, `wmux new-workspace` built one leaf — because `resolveDefaultSplitTree` took the fallback as a PARAMETER each caller filled in differently. It is now a setting with one resolution (a saved default layout first, then the configured count/arrangement), and `buildDefaultSplitTree()` is `buildWorkspaceTree(3, 'grid')` — byte-for-byte the shipped T, which is what lets it replace the old construction rather than sit beside it. `MAX_WORKSPACE_PANES` is a guard, not a limit: the value arrives from a hand-edited TOML file and over the pipe, and every pane it makes is a PTY

## Key Design Decisions

### No MCP — CLI Only
Do NOT build MCP servers. Use the wmux CLI (`wmux <command>`) via Bash instead.
The CLI talks to the named pipe, which is simpler and more reliable.
For new Claude Code integrations, add CLI commands in `src/cli/wmux.ts`.

### Branded ID Types
`WorkspaceId`, `PaneId`, `SurfaceId`, `WindowId` — branded string types in `src/shared/types.ts`.
Pattern: `surf-{uuid}`, `pane-{uuid}`, `ws-{uuid}`, `win-{uuid}`.

### Keep-Alive Tabs
Terminal tabs in a pane are ALL rendered simultaneously (hidden with `visibility: hidden`).
When switching tabs, only CSS changes — the xterm instance stays alive, no PTY reconnection needed.
The `surfaceId` is passed to `pty.create()` so PTY ID = Surface ID (enables reliable re-attachment).

### Split Tree
Pane layouts use an immutable binary tree (`SplitNode`). Each leaf = one pane with N surfaces (tabs).
Mutations go through `splitNode()`, `removeLeaf()`, `findLeaf()`, `getAllPaneIds()` in `split-utils.ts`.

### Prompt Boundaries — One Producer, Four Views (issue #207)

Highlighting a prompt, pinning it, anchoring the view at the start of an answer and
listing prompts as jump marks are four consumers of ONE fact: where a user prompt
starts. So there is one producer (`utils/prompt-log.ts`) and four independent,
individually-toggleable views — not four detectors.

Two sources feed it, **ranked and never merged**, the shape `ssh-detect.ts` uses:

| Source | Carries | Where |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `agent` | The prompt TEXT, verbatim | Claude Code's `UserPromptSubmit` hook → `wmux-hook.js` → pipe → `App.tsx` |
| `shell` | A boundary, no text | OSC 133 (FinalTerm) from the shell integration → the xterm parser |

There is deliberately **no heuristic third source**. wmux stopped guessing agent state
from screen scraping in 0.39.0 (#128) and this does not reintroduce it: with neither
source present the log stays empty and every view is inert. That is the honest outcome —
a mis-detected boundary pins the wrong text and anchors the view to the wrong line, and
the user has no way to tell it happened.

Four things about this are easy to get wrong and expensive to rediscover:

- **`layer: 'bottom'` does NOT put a decoration under the glyphs, and cannot.** xterm
  gives its decoration container `z-index: 6` while the renderer's canvas is `z-index: 2`,
  so a decoration's DOM element always paints OVER the text; `layer` orders decorations
  against each other and nothing else. 2.4.0 tinted the prompt rows with a CSS
  `::before` on that element, which therefore had to sit at `opacity: .12` or it washed
  out the text it was pointing at — and at 12% over a terminal background every hue
  collapses to the same near-neutral grey. The colour picker in Settings → Prompts
  worked perfectly and looked completely broken; users reported it as "the rail is
  always grey whatever colour I pick". The tint is now the decoration's
  `backgroundColor`, which both renderers composite into the CELL background before
  drawing glyphs — the layer the CSS was only pretending to be on. Two consequences:
  the alpha must be **pre-blended in JS** against `terminal.options.theme.background`
  (xterm IGNORES the alpha channel there — `#ff2d5540` and `#ff2d55` paint identically),
  and the rail stays in CSS as the one element carrying the user's colour at full
  saturation. If you are ever tempted to style a decoration's background in CSS again,
  this is why it does not work.
- **The prompt text is read out of the BUFFER for a shell**, never sent over the pipe.
  Main already refuses to broadcast `report_command` to a renderer because a command
  line is where a credential reliably shows up (`index.ts`, the `report_command`
  hard-stop). The renderer is already displaying those bytes, so lifting them from the
  buffer adds no new crossing. Only the agent source sends text, and only because an
  agent TUI repaints over its own input box — nothing that reads the screen afterwards
  can recover it.
- **Markers do not survive a split-tree restructure.** A remount replays the buffer as
  serialized TEXT (`snapshotSurfaceBuffer`), which carries no markers. Those prompts stay
  in the outline with `line: null` and a disabled jump, rather than scrolling the user
  somewhere arbitrary.
- **The anchor's pending-line count is NOT in the store.** It changes on every PTY chunk;
  a store write there re-renders every subscriber at PTY speed, which is the shape of
  #141. It lives in a module map like `surfaceMouseModes`, and the pill subscribes to a
  throttled DOM event.

Defaults: `highlight` and `anchor` ON, `pin` OFF (it costs vertical space), `outline`
available but closed, and `anchorScope: 'agent'` — anchoring applies to AGENT answers
only. That last one is the load-bearing default: a shell following its own output is
not the problem #207 describes, it is what every terminal has done for forty years, and
silently holding `npm run build` back from streaming reads as a freeze rather than as a
feature. `'all'` opts shell command lines in.

Governed by `promptDefaultRev` — changing any of them later needs a rev bump plus a
`PROMPT_PROMOTIONS` entry, or it reaches nobody (prefs persist as whole blocks). Adding
a NEW field is free (`{...DEFAULTS, ...stored}` fills it in); only changing an existing
default needs the rev.

**The outline has two presentations, and `outlineMode` picks which one the command
opens.** `'overlay'` is the docked panel from 2.4.0 — it floats over the terminal it
lists, which is right for a glance and wrong for anything you keep open, because it
covers the output it is describing. `'pane'` opens a `prompts` SURFACE instead, which
lives in the split tree and so splits, resizes and persists like any other pane.
`'overlay'` stays the default: a preference that silently changes what an existing key
does is a bug report. Both are always reachable — the tab bar's `+` menu and
`wmux new-surface --type prompts` make a pane regardless of the setting, and
`outlineSide` is greyed out under `'pane'` because the split tree already decides that.
Neither is a second implementation: both read the same per-surface prompt log and jump
through the same marks.

**Anchoring is armed before it is engaged, and the distinction is the whole design.**
A prompt is submitted at the BOTTOM of the buffer, so its line is `>= ydisp`.
`scrollToLine` on such a line takes xterm's "already at the bottom" branch: it sets
`isUserScrolling = false`, clamps, and does not move. The next write then scrolls, and
`BufferService` does `if (!isUserScrolling) ydisp = ybase` before firing `onScroll` — so
a naive listener sees `viewportY === baseY`, reads it as "the user caught up", and
releases. Every time, on the first line of output. The first implementation did exactly
that and the feature held nothing; the tests missed it because the fake terminal let
`scrollToLine` move the viewport anywhere. So: **armed** = recorded but the prompt is
still on the last screen and nothing is hidden; **engaged** = the buffer has grown past
it and the viewport is genuinely held. The release-on-bottom rule applies only while
engaged. `tests/unit/prompt-anchor.test.ts` models xterm's real clamp and its
fill-the-screen-then-grow-baseY behaviour, and pins this.

The anchor holds a **resolver**, not a line number: an absolute buffer line stops meaning
the same row once the scrollback fills and lines are trimmed off the top. The prompt's
xterm marker tracks that; a snapshot does not. A resolver answering null (the marker
died) is the anchor's cue to let go rather than hold a row that no longer exists.

## Release Process (CRITICAL)

wmux is distributed as a **portable zip** (not NSIS installer) because without code-signing, Windows SmartScreen flags installers more aggressively than zip extractions.

### Step-by-step

```bash
# 1. Build everything
npm run build:main        # Compile TS → dist/main/, dist/preload/, dist/cli/
npx vite build            # Build renderer → dist/renderer/

# 2. Verify compiled code
# Check that fixes are in the compiled output:
python -c "import re; f=open('dist/renderer/assets/index-*.js').read(); print('OK' if 'your_fix_marker' in f else 'MISSING')"
grep -c 'your_fix_string' dist/main/index.js

# 3. Create ASAR staging
# IMPORTANT: always run from the project root (use absolute paths or cd back
# after any `cd .asar-staging`). If cwd drifts into .asar-staging during this
# section, subsequent `mkdir build-out` lands INSIDE the staging dir and the
# next asar pack will recursively include its own previous output → 188M asar.
rm -rf .asar-staging build-out
mkdir -p .asar-staging build-out
cp -r dist .asar-staging/dist          # explicit dest path — trailing-slash form is flaky on Git Bash
cp package.json .asar-staging/package.json
( cd .asar-staging && npm install --omit=dev --ignore-scripts )   # subshell — cwd doesn't leak
rm -rf .asar-staging/node_modules/node-pty/build   # force prebuilds load path: conpty.dll (useConptyDll) resolves relative to the LOADED conpty.node, and only prebuilds/win32-x64/ has the conpty/ dir next to it

# 4. Pack ASAR (with native module unpacking)
# Use --unpack-dir (path-based), NOT --unpack "**/*.node" — the glob form
# silently fails on Git Bash for Windows (shell eats the pattern, asar produces
# the asar but creates no .unpacked dir, no error). Output to build-out/ so we
# never touch the live resources/app.asar while wmux may be running.
npx asar pack .asar-staging build-out/app.asar --unpack-dir "node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds"

# 5. Verify native modules are unpacked
ls build-out/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/win32-x64/
# Must contain: conpty.node, conpty_console_list.node, pty.node
# Sanity: compare against the PREVIOUS release's app.asar, not a fixed number —
# it was ~24M at 0.7.x and ~34M at 2.4.0, so a stale constant here reads as a
# packaging failure on a healthy build. What actually matters: natives unpacked
# moved out; 180M+ means staging got polluted (see step 3 warning).

# 5b. Verify the PRs/fixes you intended to ship are actually inside the ASAR.
# extract-file's stdout piping is unreliable on Windows — extract to /tmp instead.
rm -rf /tmp/asar-verify && mkdir -p /tmp/asar-verify
( cd /tmp/asar-verify && npx --prefix "$(pwd)" asar extract "$(pwd)/build-out/app.asar" . )
grep -c 'your_fix_marker' /tmp/asar-verify/dist/renderer/assets/index-*.js
grep -c 'your_fix_string' /tmp/asar-verify/dist/main/index.js

# 6. Create release staging
# Easiest base: the previous release zip. Avoids needing a separate
# wmux_v_extracted/ dir and avoids picking up stray files from the project root.
rm -rf ../wmux-release-staging

### Release Checklist

- [ ] `npm run build:main` succeeds
- [ ] `npx vite build` succeeds
- [ ] Compiled code verified (grep for key changes in dist/)
- [ ] ASAR packed with `--unpack-dir node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds` (NOT `--unpack` glob)
- [ ] ASAR size within ~10% of the previous release's app.asar (34M at 2.4.0; the old "~24M" constant is stale). A sudden 2x+ ⇒ unpack didn't take. 180M+ ⇒ staging polluted.
- [ ] node-pty native modules present in `app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/win32-x64/`
- [ ] PR-specific markers grep-confirmed inside the packed ASAR (extracted to /tmp)
- [ ] wmux-orchestrator plugin copied to release staging
- [ ] cli-bin + cli-bin-ps copied to release staging (issue #154)
- [ ] opencode-plugin copied to release staging (issue #149) — `npm test` now derives this from `process.resourcesPath` usage in `src/main/`, so a new runtime resource that isn't in `extraResources` fails the release build
- [ ] `resources/cli/` holds all four files — `wmux.js`, `wmux-hook.js`, `transport-deadline.js`, `wsl-network.js`. The CLI is packaged file-by-file, so a shared module has to be listed on its own; `npm test` derives this from the relative imports in `src/cli/`
- [ ] rcedit applied (icon + version metadata) — `{ rcedit }` destructured
- [ ] `latest.yml` generated (sha512 + size of the final zip) and uploaded as a release asset — electron-updater 404s without it (issue #68)
- [ ] Zip created and uploaded to GitHub release
- [ ] Mark of the Web: remind user to right-click > Unblock after download

### Important Notes

- **rcedit can't modify a running exe** — always work on a copy
- **rcedit named export**: `const { rcedit } = require('rcedit')`. Non-destructured `const rcedit = require('rcedit')` throws "rcedit is not a function" (different from older docs).
- **asar `--unpack` glob silently fails on Git Bash for Windows**: pattern like `"**/*.node"` gets shell-eaten and asar emits no `.unpacked/` dir, no error. Use `--unpack-dir node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds` (path-based) instead.
- **Bash cwd drift can recursively pollute staging**: if you `cd .asar-staging` and forget to come back, the next `mkdir build-out && asar pack` creates `.asar-staging/build-out/app.asar`, and a re-pack will swallow its own output into the new asar (188M). Always use subshells `( cd dir && cmd )` or absolute paths.
- **Don't pack ASAR directly to `resources/app.asar`** if wmux may be running — pack to `build-out/` and copy at step 7.
- **MOTW (Mark of the Web)**: Downloaded zips get `Zone.Identifier` NTFS stream. Fix: `powershell "Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File"`
- **Windows taskbar pinning** uses PE `FileDescription` for the shortcut name — ensure rcedit sets it to "wmux"
- **AppUserModelId** is set to `com.wmux.app` in `src/main/index.ts` for proper taskbar grouping

## Named Pipe V2 Handlers

The pipe server in `index.ts` handles V2 JSON-RPC methods. Most delegate to the renderer via `executeJavaScript('window.__wmux_*(...)')`. The renderer's `pipe-bridge.ts` exposes Zustand store operations as these globals.

**Fully implemented V2 methods:**
- `system.identify`, `system.capabilities`, `system.tree`
- `workspace.create`, `workspace.close`, `workspace.select`, `workspace.rename`, `workspace.list`, `workspace.current`
- `pane.split`, `pane.close`, `pane.focus`, `pane.zoom`, `pane.list`
- `surface.create`, `surface.close`, `surface.focus`, `surface.rename`, `surface.list`
- `surface.send_text`, `surface.send_key`, `surface.read_text`, `surface.trigger_flash`
- `surface.list_prompts` — the prompt log (#207). Diverges from `surface.read_text` on the multi-window lookup, deliberately: `read_text` can tell "this window does not own that terminal" from "the screen is blank" and so takes the first window that answers without an error, but a prompt log cannot — an unowned surface and a surface with nothing recorded both answer `[]`. So the targeted form takes the first NON-EMPTY answer, and the untargeted form MERGES across windows rather than reading the first reply, since "every tracked surface" is a fact about the app and each window keeps its own store
- `markdown.set_content`, `markdown.load_file`, `markdown.get_content`
- `notification.list`, `notification.clear`
- `sidebar.set_status`, `sidebar.set_progress`, `sidebar.log`, `sidebar.get_state`
- `browser.*` — routed per surface by its engine: `web` → the CDP bridge, `agent` → the agent-browser CLI. `engineForSurface` asks the RENDERER (the split tree lives in the Zustand store, main has no copy) and asks EVERY window, first affirmative wins — the surface may be in window 2, the #143 "window ≠ workspace" mistake. A renderer that has never heard of `__wmux_getBrowserEngine`, or a rejected `executeJavaScript`, answers `web`: this runs on the hot path of every browser command, where it previously did no renderer IPC at all. The engine is re-checked on **every** outcome of target resolution, not only when there was no wcId — a surface toggled web→agent keeps a valid CDP registration (nothing detaches on a toggle), so the null-branch-only shortcut drives CDP against agent-browser's own dashboard SPA and silently corrupts the pane the user is watching
- `browser.get_engine`, `browser.set_engine` — matched BEFORE the generic `browser.*` passthrough, or they fall into the verb switch and come back as `Unknown: browser.get_engine` (-32601). `set_engine` validates `web`/`agent` and refuses a surface that is not a browser surface
- `agent.spawn`, `agent.spawn_batch`, `agent.status`, `agent.list`, `agent.kill`
- `pane.report_agent`, `pane.report_agent_session`, `pane.report_metadata`, `pane.release_agent`, `pane.agent_state`
- `pane.answer_agent` — the back-channel (issue #128). The only non-`report_*` method: it WRITES into a pane's PTY. Guarded — refuses unless the pane is currently `blocked`, and only ever sends a payload the agent itself declared
- `hook.event`, `diff.refresh`

## wmux-orchestrator Plugin

Claude Code plugin bundled in `resources/wmux-orchestrator/`. Installed into `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` on startup by `ensureOrchestratorPlugin()` in `claude-context.ts` — but only when the user has granted the `orchestrator` feature (issue #132); `agent-integration.ts` owns that call. Also published standalone: `github.com/amirlehmam/wmux-orchestrator`.

**What it does:** Decomposes complex dev tasks into parallel Claude Code agents coordinated through dependency-aware waves with automated review. With wmux: each agent in its own visible terminal pane. Without wmux: falls back to native subagents.

**Plugin structure:**
```
resources/wmux-orchestrator/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json    Manifest (name, version, author)
  commands/orchestrate.md       /wmux:orchestrate slash command
  skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md   Core: codebase analysis, wave planning, agent spawning
  skills/reviewer/SKILL.md      Post-orchestration review and auto-fix
  skills/wmux-detect/SKILL.md   Detects wmux availability for degraded mode
  agents/wmux-worker.md         Worker template with file zone enforcement
  hooks/hooks.json              PostToolUse, SubagentStop, Stop, SessionStart
  scripts/json-tool.js          Node.js JSON helper (replaces jq)
  scripts/orchestration-state.sh  State file management library
  scripts/spawn-agents.sh       Creates panes + launches Claude Code agents
  scripts/on-agent-stop.sh      Wave transition driver (core orchestration)
  scripts/check-status.sh       Markdown dashboard generator
  scripts/*.sh                  Other utilities (cleanup, collect-results, etc.)
```

**Key design:** Skills handle intelligence (prompts), hooks handle reactivity (events), scripts handle wmux operations (CLI). State shared via JSON file in TMPDIR. No daemon.

                                       # on, which is why the global CLAUDE.md wmux
                                       # writes never has to mention any of this.
# ENGINE DIVERGENCE — the only one, so it is written down rather than discovered:
# `wmux browser wait <ref> [ms]` sends a ref AND a timeout. In `web` mode both reach
# cdpBridge.wait(ref, timeout) and the ms is honoured. agent-browser's `wait
# <selector>` has no per-call timeout flag at all — only the global
# AGENT_BROWSER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (25 s) — so in `agent` mode the caller's ms is
# DROPPED and the ref wins. Unrepresentable in argv, not fixable in the verb table;
# see the KNOWN ENGINE DIVERGENCE note in src/main/agent-browser-verbs.ts. Every
# other verb behaves identically on both engines.

## Shell Integration

Scripts in `src/shell-integration/` (deployed to `resources/shell-integration/`):

| Script | Reports |
|--------|---------|
| `wmux-powershell-integration.ps1` | cwd, git branch/dirty, shell state, PR polling (45s), OSC 133 A/B/C/D |
| `wmux-bash-integration.sh` | cwd, git branch/dirty, shell state, ports, OSC 133 A/B/C/D (bash + zsh) |
| `wmux-cmd-integration.cmd` | Basic OSC 9 escape sequences, OSC 133 A/B (no C/D — cmd has no preexec seam, so they are not representable and are deliberately not faked) |

`resources/shell-integration/` is a checked-in **byte-identical mirror**, enforced by
`tests/unit/resources-sync.test.ts` (#168/#169) — editing a script without copying it
there fails `npm test` AND ships the old file.

**OSC 133 (#207)** carries the prompt boundaries the prompt log needs in-band, which a
pipe message arriving milliseconds later cannot: the consumer is the xterm parser, and it
needs the boundary at an exact byte offset in the stream. Two traps, both load-bearing:

- **bash needs a DOUBLED backslash for the ST terminator inside `\[ \]`.** bash decodes
  the contents of the ignore region, so ST's trailing `\` pairs with the `\` of the
  closing `\]`: the end marker is destroyed, a stray `]` leaks into the visible prompt,
  readline mis-measures the prompt width and long command lines wrap wrong. Verify with
  `printf '%s' "${PS1@P}" | od -c`, never by reading. zsh's `%{ %}` expansion is
  `%`-based and passes backslashes through, so there the plain form is the correct one.
- **PowerShell: `$?` decides, `$LASTEXITCODE` only refines.** They answer different
  questions — `$LASTEXITCODE` is the last *native* process's code, says nothing about a
  failed cmdlet, and is sticky. Using it alone reports every failed cmdlet as a success.
  Both must be captured as the first two statements of `prompt`; almost anything clobbers
  them, which is how the `interrupted` shell state sat dead for years (`Report-GitBranch`
  ran `git` before the check read `$LASTEXITCODE`).

`B`/`C` come from `PSConsoleHostReadLine`, not the PSReadLine Enter handler: that handler
runs *before* `AcceptLine` echoes the newline, so a `C` there lands on the input row and
every consumer is one row out. It also keeps the marks out of the prompt string, so
PSReadLine never has to width-count escapes — the PowerShell analogue of the `\[ \]`
problem, sidestepped rather than solved.

**The git report is one spawn, off the prompt thread.** `prompt` used to cost 55 ms per
Enter, 50 ms of it two git processes (`rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, then
`status --porcelain`). It is now a single `git --no-optional-locks status --porcelain=v2
--branch` — branch AND dirtiness in one process, `--no-optional-locks` so a status running
behind the user's back never leaves `.git/index.lock` in front of their `git commit` —
resolved once at init to `mingw64\bin\git.exe` rather than the `cmd\git.exe` launcher
(8 ms per spawn), and run in an in-process **runspace** (never `Start-Job`, which is a whole
pwsh.exe): `prompt` measures 1.4 ms, the report lands ~30 ms later. Wire text is
byte-identical to the old two-spawn form for every case in
`tests/unit/git-branch-report.test.ts` — including an unborn repo, which v2 reports as
`branch.oid (initial)` with exit 0 and which must still CLEAR, because `rev-parse` exited
128 there. The worker drains a `pending` cwd under a lock, so two Enters 47 ms apart both
report and `BeginInvoke` is never called on a pipeline still running; the cwd it is handed
is `CurrentFileSystemLocation.ProviderPath`, not `$PWD` (empty under `cd Env:`). bash mirrors
the single-spawn shape; the `\[ \]` prompt string is untouched.

Env vars set by wmux in spawned shells: `WMUX=1`, `WMUX_SURFACE_ID`, `WMUX_PIPE`, `WMUX_CLI`,
`WMUX_NODE` (+ `WMUX_NODE_ELECTRON` when it is wmux's own binary — issue #187).

## Website (wmux.org)

Static site in `site/`. Deployed to Netlify (`netlify.toml` at repo root).

```bash
# Deploy
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir site
```

`site/index.html` — Landing page with i18n (21 languages, including RTL Arabic).
`site/i18n.js` — Language switching via URL hash (`#<code>`, e.g. `#ar`, `#fr`, `#pt`, `#ja`).

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test                    # Run all unit tests
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode
npx vitest run tests/unit/pty-manager.test.ts  # Single file
```

Test files in `tests/unit/`: agent-manager, cdp-bridge, config-loader, notification-slice, pipe-server, port-scanner, pty-manager, session-persistence, shell-detector, split-tree.

---

## Conventions

- **State**: Zustand slices in `src/renderer/store/`, composed in `index.ts`
- **IPC**: Channels defined in `src/shared/types.ts`, never use magic strings
- **CSS**: `src/renderer/styles/`, class prefix per component (`.pane-wrapper__*`, `.surface-tab__*`)
- **Immutable trees**: Split tree mutations always produce new objects via `patchLeaf()`
- **PTY IDs = Surface IDs**: Always pass `surfaceId` when creating PTYs for reliable re-attachment
- **No MCP**: All Claude Code integration via CLI commands
- **French comms**: User communicates in French, code/docs in English
