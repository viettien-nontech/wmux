## New in 2.7 - the folder your agent is working in, beside the terminal it's working in

`Ctrl+Shift+X` docks a file tree on the **right of the window**, rooted at the focused pane's live working directory. Not the workspace's, and not the active tab's — the pane's *terminal* cwd, so a pane showing a markdown or browser tab still belongs to the folder its shell is in.

After an agent has been running for ten minutes, three questions follow in order. 2.6 and 2.7 answer all three without leaving wmux:

**1. What's in here?** The tree lists the folder, lazily, with full keyboard navigation (`↑↓` to move, `←→` to collapse/expand, `Enter` to open, `Esc` back to the terminal). Single-click opens a file into a *preview* tab that the next single-click reuses in place, so browsing ten files doesn't leave ten tabs behind — start editing and it promotes to a real tab. Panel width and expansion state persist per root.

**2. What changed?** Every row carries a `+55/-22` column, rolled up so a collapsed `src/` shows the sum of everything beneath it — **including folders you never expanded**, because a rollup that could only count loaded rows would quietly report the part of the tree you happened to have open. In a git repo the numbers mean everything uncommitted; outside one, everything since the session started. The panel header says which — a column of numbers that silently means one or the other can't be acted on. Files an agent touched get a dot, read from the hook stream wmux already receives, so its edits are distinguishable from yours at a glance.

**3. Can I just fix that line myself?** Anything that isn't markdown opens in a `code` surface with a line-numbered gutter, beside the terminal it came from. Hit **Edit**, change the line, `Ctrl+S`.

Three things that are deliberately **not** clever about this:

- **The tree is a jail, not a file browser.** The renderer sends a pane id and a *relative* path, never an absolute one — main derives the root itself, so a folder above the pane's cwd isn't reachable even by a renderer that asks for it. Symlinks and junctions are resolved on every path segment, not just the last one.
- **A save can only land on a file you opened in a pane, in this window, in this session** — and it carries the timestamp the buffer was read at. If an agent rewrote the file while you were typing, the save is **refused** rather than quietly picking a winner. CRLF line endings and UTF-16/BOM encodings survive the round trip instead of being normalised into a whole-file rewrite in your next commit.
- **With no hooks configured there are simply no agent dots**, and every number still works. Same rule the prompt log follows: degrade to honest silence, never to a guess.

## New in 2.0 - wmux sees every agent, not just Claude Code

Until now wmux could only tell you what an agent was doing if that agent **told it**. That meant Claude Code (hooks), OpenCode (plugin) and Kiro. Codex, Gemini, Aider, Amp, Cursor and Copilot ran in panes wmux could display and could not read.

2.0 closes that with three layers, each of which only fills the gap the one above left:

**1. One roster for every agent in the window.** wmux already knew which panes were blocked — it just never said so above a single sidebar row. Now a banner over the workspace list answers *"who needs me?"* across every workspace at once, ranked by who has been waiting longest.

**2. `Ctrl+Shift+A` — the agent navigator.** Every agent in the window in one list, blocked first. Filter with `a`/`b`/`w`/`i`/`u`, `↑↓` to move, `enter` to jump straight to the pane — it selects the workspace *and* raises the tab, so an agent buried in a background tab is one keystroke away. **`Ctrl+Shift+B`** goes straight to whoever has waited longest, and cycles on repeat.

**3. wmux now identifies and reads agents that report nothing.** It works out which agent a pane is running from the command line you typed or the shell wmux launched, then matches the agent's own on-screen UI against bundled rules to tell *blocked* from *working*. All of it local — nothing is sent anywhere.

Three things that are deliberately **not** clever about this:

- **A detected state never overrides a reported one.** If an agent tells wmux it is working, that wins over anything the screen looks like. wmux's "needs you" never expires and answering it doesn't clear it, so a rule re-reading a repainted frame would leave you clicking a button that does nothing.
- **When wmux can't parse a screen it says so.** No rule matched means the pane reads *silent*, never *idle* — because "idle" is a claim, and nobody made it. A new prompt shape wmux hasn't learned yet shows as "we don't know", which is the honest answer and the one that doesn't hide a pane needing you.
- **You can see exactly why.** `wmux detect explain` names the rule that fired and the line that matched. `wmux detect explain --file screen.txt` replays a captured screen offline, so you can debug or author a rule without the agent even installed.

Screen detection is on by default, skips every pane whose agent reports properly, and is one click off in **Settings → Workspace**. Rules live in `%APPDATA%\wmux\agent-detection` if you want to add or fix one.

> Bundled rules currently cover **Claude Code** (blocked / working / idle), plus **Codex** and **OpenCode** (identity and idle). Anything else is identified but reads as *silent* until someone contributes rules — `wmux detect explain --file` is how you write them, and PRs are very welcome.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="middle">
<h3>Passive Claude Code integration</h3>
wmux observes Claude Code without changing how it works. Auto-configured hooks in <code>~/.claude/settings.json</code> report agent and tool activity to the sidebar. A CDP proxy on <code>localhost:9222</code> lets Claude Code's native <code>chrome-devtools-mcp</code> plugin control the wmux browser panel directly. Zero setup — everything is auto-injected on startup.

<td width="40%" valign="middle">
<h3>Live browser visibility</h3>
When Claude Code browses the web, every action appears in the wmux browser panel in real-time. Navigate, click, type, take screenshots — Claude Code uses its own tools, wmux just shows what's happening. CDP proxy on <code>localhost:9222</code> bridges the connection transparently. Terminal and markdown links open in the panel too.

<h3>Activity indicators</h3>
Sidebar dots show what each agent session is doing at a glance. <b>Violet pulsing</b> = needs you. <b>Orange pulsing</b> = working. <b>Green</b> = done. <b>Red</b> = interrupted (Ctrl+C). A <b>hollow</b> dot means wmux read that state off the screen rather than being told it — the colour says what, the fill says how sure. Blocked and working also mark the <b>tab</b>, so an agent waiting in a background tab is visible without opening it. Git branch, dirty state, working directory, open ports, and PR status update in real-time from shell integration hooks.

<h3>Agent roster &amp; navigator</h3>
A banner above the workspace list answers <i>"who needs me?"</i> across every workspace at once, with the longest wait first — click it to jump straight there. <code>Ctrl+Shift+A</code> opens the full navigator: every agent in the window, blocked first, filterable by state with a single keystroke. <code>Ctrl+Shift+B</code> cycles through whoever is waiting. Both are bound by default, because a shortcut you have to discover in Settings is one you won't have when you need it.

<h3>Reads agents that report nothing</h3>
Codex, Gemini, Aider, Amp, Cursor and Copilot don't tell any multiplexer what they're doing. wmux works out which agent a pane runs — from the command you typed, the shell it launched, or the process tree — then matches the agent's own UI against bundled rules to tell blocked from working. Entirely local. It never overrides what an agent actually reports, and when it can't parse a screen it says <i>silent</i> rather than guessing <i>idle</i>. <code>wmux detect explain</code> shows which rule fired.

- **Release update badge** — A badge in the title bar notifies you when a new GitHub release is available. Click to download and install in place (works for zip extracts and NSIS installs). Settings → Help has the same action next to the version number.
- **Clickable links** — URLs in terminal output and markdown panes open directly in the wmux browser panel. Prefer your own browser? **Settings → Browser → Open links in the system browser** flips the default, and Ctrl+click always does the opposite of whichever way it is set.
- **Scriptable** — Named pipe server (`\\.\pipe\wmux`) with a JSON-RPC API. Create workspaces, split panes, send keystrokes, read terminal content, control the browser via CDP, and spawn sub-agent terminals programmatically.
- **Windows native** — ConPTY for proper terminal emulation, Windows toast notifications, taskbar flash on alerts, native title bar overlay.
- **Windows Terminal + Ghostty compatible** — Import your themes, fonts, and colors from Windows Terminal `settings.json` or `~/.config/ghostty/config`. Ships with 450+ bundled Ghostty themes.
- **GPU-accelerated** — xterm.js with WebGL rendering for smooth terminal output at any speed.

## Install

### Download (recommended)

Download [wmux-0.7.10-win-x64.zip](https://github.com/amirlehmam/wmux/releases/latest) from GitHub Releases, extract anywhere, and run `wmux.exe`. No installer, no code signing, no admin required.

> **Note:** After extracting, right-click the zip before extracting and select **Unblock** if Windows SmartScreen warns about the executable.

### Updates & security

wmux checks GitHub Releases for updates. Clicking the titlebar badge or the
**Check for updates** button in Settings → Help downloads and installs in
place — including portable zip extracts (the recommended install). Unattended
NSIS downloads are held in a quarantine window (3 days by default) before
installing, and installs always require an explicit confirmation click —
nothing is applied silently.

Release artifacts are **not yet Authenticode-signed** (SignPath OSS approval is
pending; the CI signing pipeline is wired and activates automatically once the
signing secrets are configured). Until signing lands, security-sensitive or
air-gapped environments can control the updater with environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `WMUX_DISABLE_UPDATER=1` | Disable the auto-updater entirely (update manually from GitHub Releases) |
| `WMUX_MIN_RELEASE_AGE_DAYS=N` | Change the quarantine window (default 3 days) |

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirlehmam/wmux.git
cd wmux
npm install
npm run build:main
npm run dev
```

## Why wmux?

I run a lot of Claude Code sessions in parallel. On macOS there is [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), and it is exactly what I needed — vertical tabs with live metadata, notification rings when agents need attention, a scriptable browser, and a socket API for automation. But I work on Windows, and nothing like it existed.

Windows Terminal has tabs but no notification system. You have to manually check each tab to see if an agent finished or is waiting for input. tmux works in WSL but loses all Windows integration. Electron terminals exist but none focus on the AI agent workflow.

So I built wmux — a visibility layer for AI coding agents. It doesn't replace Claude Code or change how it works. It passively observes and shows you what's happening. A CDP proxy on `localhost:9222` lets Claude Code's native browser tools control the wmux browser panel — you watch every page load, click, and form fill in real-time. Auto-configured hooks in `settings.json` report tool usage and agent activity to the sidebar. When a command finishes or is interrupted, the sidebar dot changes color and you get a notification.

The sidebar shows exactly what each agent is doing — the git branch it is on, the PR it opened, the ports it is listening on, and whether it needs your attention. Shell integration scripts inject themselves into PowerShell, CMD, and Bash sessions and report CWD changes, git branch switches, shell state, and PR status back to the sidebar via a named pipe in real time.

Since 2.0 that no longer depends on the agent cooperating. wmux identifies which agent a pane is running and, for the ones that report nothing of their own, reads their on-screen UI to tell blocked from working — so Codex and Aider sit in the same roster as Claude Code. The ranking is the point: with ten workspaces open, the question is never "what is agent #7 doing", it is "which one of these has stopped and is waiting on me", and that answer is one banner and one keystroke away.

On first launch wmux asks before it touches anything outside its own directory, and what it then writes is listed feature by feature in Settings → General: a marked block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`, a `chrome-devtools` MCP entry pointed at its own browser panel, and a CDP proxy on `localhost:9222`. No API keys needed — everything runs through the user's existing Claude Code session. Every one of those has an uninstall, and turning a feature off runs it.

Everything is automatable through the `wmux` CLI or the named pipe directly. The protocol matches cmux, so tools built for one work with the other.

## wmux-orchestrator (deprecated in 2.12.0)

**wmux no longer installs a Claude Code plugin.** Since 2.12.0 it removes the one
it used to install, and takes its entry out of `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`
on the way.

Two reasons. It never worked: wmux hand-wrote Claude Code's internal plugin
registry in a shape that file does not use, so Claude Code never listed the
plugin, never loaded its skills or commands, and marked the copied files
orphaned — while wmux logged a successful install (issue #239, reported in
full detail by [@mkh63d](https://github.com/mkh63d)). And it is no longer worth
repairing: Claude Code now runs parallel agents natively, which is a better
answer than a shell-script wave planner driving panes from the outside.

What is unaffected:

- **The sidebar orchestration panel.** It reads a run's `state.json` and does
  not care who wrote it, so an orchestrator you install yourself still lights
  it up.
- **`wmux agent spawn` / `spawn-batch`.** Putting an agent in a visible pane
  was never the plugin's job — it is a CLI verb, and it stays.
- **The OpenCode plugin**, which is a different file in a different place and
  installs correctly. It is still what the Settings → General *Orchestrator
  plugin* toggle controls.

The plugin itself remains available standalone, installable the supported way:
[plugin.wmux.org](https://plugin.wmux.org) · [github.com/amirlehmam/wmux-orchestrator](https://github.com/amirlehmam/wmux-orchestrator)

## Shell Integration

wmux automatically injects integration scripts into your shells:

- **PowerShell** — Overrides the `prompt` function. Reports CWD, git branch, dirty state, and shell state (working/done/interrupted) via `NamedPipeClientStream`. Preexec hook via PSReadLine detects when commands start. Background job polls `gh pr view` every 45 seconds.
- **CMD** — Embeds OSC 9 escape sequences in the `PROMPT` variable for CWD reporting.
- **Bash/Zsh (WSL)** — `PROMPT_COMMAND` / `precmd` + `preexec` hooks. Detects interrupts via exit code 130. Communicates via temp file bridge.

Environment variables available in all shells:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WMUX` | Always `1` inside wmux |
| `WMUX_CLI` | Path to the wmux CLI script |
| `WMUX_NODE` | A JS runtime that can run `WMUX_CLI` — resolved by wmux, since `node` is not always on PATH |
| `WMUX_NODE_ELECTRON` | `1` when `WMUX_NODE` is wmux's own binary and needs `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` |
| `WMUX_SURFACE_ID` | Current surface (tab) ID |
| `WMUX_PIPE` | Named pipe path (`\\.\pipe\wmux`) |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

All shortcuts are rebindable via Settings (`Ctrl+,`).

The two number-row families — "jump to workspace N" and "jump to surface N" —
are one dropdown each under **Settings → Keyboard → Number-row shortcuts**,
rather than eighteen separate rows. Pick the modifiers each answers to
(`Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Ctrl+Alt`, `Ctrl+Shift`, `Alt+Shift`) or switch either off so
the digits reach the terminal untouched. Assigning one family a combo the other
holds swaps them, so trading `Ctrl+1–9` and `Ctrl+Alt+1–9` is a single click.

# Remote wmux management (SSH tunnel)
# On the remote machine — expose its wmux pipe on localhost TCP and get its token:
wmux bridge                        # 127.0.0.1:9787 ↔ \\.\pipe\wmux (pure relay, token still required)
wmux token                         # print the auth token, copy it

# On your machine — tunnel the port, then drive the remote wmux with any command:
# ssh -L 9787:127.0.0.1:9787 user@host
wmux --remote 127.0.0.1:9787 --token <TOKEN> list-workspaces
wmux --remote 127.0.0.1:9787 --token <TOKEN> new-workspace --title "api"
# Or set once: WMUX_REMOTE=127.0.0.1:9787 and WMUX_REMOTE_TOKEN=<TOKEN>

# From a devcontainer — same transport, no SSH tunnel. Run the bridge in WSL2
# (--wsl binds 0.0.0.0 there, reachable from the container, not from the LAN):
wmux bridge --wsl                  # relays to \\.\pipe\wmux via npiperelay.exe
# Then in the container: WMUX_REMOTE=host.docker.internal:9787 + WMUX_REMOTE_TOKEN
# Full setup: docs/DEVCONTAINER.md

# Agents
wmux agent spawn --cmd "claude --resume abc" --label "Research"
wmux agent spawn-batch --json '[{"cmd":"claude","label":"Agent 1"},{"cmd":"claude","label":"Agent 2"}]'
wmux agent list                    # List all agents
wmux agent status <agent-id>       # Check agent status
wmux agent kill <agent-id>         # Kill an agent

wmux tree                          # Workspace / pane / surface hierarchy
```

### Files in direct SSH panes

When a pane was opened with `wmux ssh`, or its PowerShell/Bash integration sees
you run a direct `ssh` command, wmux keeps local file insertion useful on the
remote host:

- `Ctrl+V` and `Ctrl+Shift+V` upload a clipboard screenshot or copied local
  file, then insert its remote path. Text paste is unchanged.
- Dropping one or more files uploads them in order. Hold Shift while dropping
  to bypass upload for that drop.
- Uploads use Windows OpenSSH `scp` with `BatchMode=yes`, so authentication must
  already work non-interactively through a key or `ssh-agent`; wmux never opens
  a password or passphrase prompt in the background.
- Files are given unique names inside a private batch directory such as
  `/tmp/wmux-drop-<batch-id>/<file-id>.png`. They remain on the remote host
  after a successful upload for the receiving program to use.

This applies to a **direct SSH connection from Windows**. A second `ssh` started
inside the remote shell is a nested connection that wmux cannot observe through
the Windows process tree. wmux may still see the outer connection, so disable
upload (or hold Shift for a drop) rather than relying on automatic upload while
you are on the inner host.

Paste and drop uploads default to on. Configure them independently in
[`~/.wmux/config.toml`](docs/config.md#remote-file-upload).

## Socket API

Connect to `\\.\pipe\wmux` for programmatic control. Two protocols supported:

**V1** (text, used by shell integration):
```
report_pwd <surface_id> <path>
report_git_branch <surface_id> <branch> [dirty]
report_shell_state <surface_id> idle|running|interrupted
report_startup_command <surface_id> <command>   # how to restore this surface; must be cwd-independent
notify <surface_id> <text>
ping
```

`wmux raw-v1 "<line>"` sends any of these through the CLI's transport, which is
what lets a shell with no reachable pipe — inside a devcontainer — still report.
See [docs/DEVCONTAINER.md](docs/DEVCONTAINER.md).

**V2** (JSON-RPC, used by CLI and automation):
```json
{"method": "workspace.create", "params": {"title": "Agent 1"}}
{"method": "workspace.list", "params": {}}
{"method": "surface.send_text", "params": {"id": "surf-...", "text": "npm test\n"}}
{"method": "surface.read_text", "params": {"id": "surf-...", "lines": 50}}

// Browser control (CDP-powered)
{"method": "browser.navigate", "params": {"url": "http://localhost:3000"}}
{"method": "browser.snapshot", "params": {}}
{"method": "browser.click", "params": {"ref": "e5"}}
{"method": "browser.screenshot", "params": {"fullPage": true}}
{"method": "browser.eval", "params": {"js": "document.title"}}

// Agent spawning
{"method": "agent.spawn", "params": {"cmd": "claude --resume abc", "label": "Research"}}
{"method": "agent.spawn_batch", "params": {"agents": [...], "strategy": "distribute"}}
{"method": "agent.list", "params": {}}
{"method": "agent.kill", "params": {"agentId": "agent-..."}}

{"method": "system.tree", "params": {}}
```

## Session Restore

On relaunch, wmux restores:

- Window position and size
- Workspace layout (titles, colors, pin state)
- Split pane structure (directions and ratios)
- Working directory per terminal
- Default shell per terminal
- Browser panel URLs
- Active workspace and pane selection

wmux does **not** restore live process state — a running tmux or vim is gone after a restart, and shells are respawned fresh in the saved working directories.

Claude Code is the one exception, and it is opt-in. Turn on **Settings → Workspace → Resume Claude Code sessions on restore** and each terminal that was running Claude when the session was saved comes back with `claude --resume <id>` in the directory it was in. This resumes the *conversation*, not the process: wmux records which session each pane was on and asks Claude to pick it back up. A pane is skipped when Claude no longer has that conversation on disk, and a Claude you exited cleanly is not resumed. Off by default, because every such pane starts an agent the moment the window opens.

## Config

### Remote file upload

Control SCP upload for direct SSH panes in `~/.wmux/config.toml`:

```toml
[remote]
upload-on-paste = true
upload-on-drop  = true
```

Both settings default to `true` and apply after `wmux reload-config`. See
[Remote file upload](docs/config.md#remote-file-upload) for behavior and
limitations.

### Terminal themes

Set a global default color scheme in `~/.wmux/config.toml`:

```toml
[terminal]
color_scheme = "Dracula"
```

Override per pane at split time or on the fly:

```bash
wmux split --color-scheme "Tokyo Night"
wmux set-color-scheme "Solarized Dark"
```

Define custom named schemes in Settings > Terminal > Custom Schemes.

### Key remaps

Change what a key sends to the program running in a terminal — add a `[keys]`
section to `~/.wmux/config.toml`:

```toml
[keys]
"ctrl+k"       = "<C-k><Delete>"   # kill to end of line, then pull the next line up
"ctrl+alt+r"   = "clear<CR>"       # text outside <> is typed literally
"ctrl+shift+q" = ""                # empty value swallows the key
```

Remaps apply inside terminal panes and take priority over wmux's own shortcuts
there. `wmux reload-config` applies edits without a restart. Full token list in
[docs/config.md](docs/config.md#key-remaps).

### Import from existing terminal configs

wmux reads configuration from:

1. **Windows Terminal** — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_...\LocalState\settings.json`
2. **Ghostty** — `~/.config/ghostty/config`

Import either via Settings > Terminal > Import. Extracts font family, font size, color scheme, and palette. Default theme is Dracula. 450+ Ghostty themes bundled.

## Architecture

Two-process Electron model. Main process manages PTY spawning (node-pty/ConPTY), named pipe server, CDP browser bridge, port scanning, git/PR polling, notifications, Claude Code context injection, session persistence, and multi-window lifecycle. Renderer process runs React/Zustand with xterm.js (WebGL), recursive split pane layout, and the sidebar.

```

  main/               # Electron main process
  renderer/           # React app (sidebar, splits, terminals, browser)
  preload/            # contextBridge API
  cli/                # wmux CLI tool
  shared/             # Types shared between main and renderer

## Based on cmux

wmux is an independent, from-scratch Windows reimplementation inspired by [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), the macOS terminal for multitasking. It shares cmux's design philosophy and is wire-compatible with its socket protocol — tools built for cmux's API work with wmux — but it does not reuse cmux's source code.

### Reporting a crash

Run `wmux crash-report` and paste the output. **Do not send a crash dump** — a
Windows minidump carries your process environment block in cleartext, and wmux's
users are exactly the people who keep credentials there. See
[docs/crash-reports.md](docs/crash-reports.md).

### Reporting an OpenCode sidebar problem

Set `WMUX_PLUGIN_DEBUG=1`, reproduce, and attach the log it writes to your temp
directory. See [docs/opencode-plugin.md](docs/opencode-plugin.md).
