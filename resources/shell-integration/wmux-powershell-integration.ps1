#
# B used to be emitted here too, on the reasoning that PSConsoleHostReadLine is
# the seam between the prompt being drawn and the first keystroke. It is — but
# only for prompts that are followed by a read-line. PSReadLine's ClearScreen
# (Ctrl+L, a routine keystroke) does not end the read-line it is in the middle
# of: it calls InvokePrompt(), which re-runs `prompt` ALONE and never re-enters
# this function. So A came out once per prompt while B came out once per
# submitted line, and every Ctrl+L left an A with no B behind it — enough for
# the #207 consumers to discard the command typed next, which gets no outline
# entry, no highlight and no anchor. B now travels inside the prompt string,
# where it is emitted by whatever draws the prompt; see the prompt function.

        #
        # Reliability: PSReadLine's ClearScreen re-runs this function alone,
        # through InvokePrompt(), without ending the read-line it is inside — so
        # a B that came from the read-line wrapper never arrived for that prompt.
        # Anything that draws the prompt now draws B with it, because B is part
        # of what "the prompt" is.
        #
        # Position: InvokePrompt evaluates `prompt` FIRST and homes the cursor
        # only afterwards, so a console write put A on whichever row the cursor
        # happened to be on before the screen was cleared. The host writes the
        # returned string after positioning, so the marks travel with the prompt
        # they describe.

        # This is the arrangement the earlier code avoided, for fear of handing
        # PSReadLine a prompt whose escape bytes it would have to recognise as
        # zero-width — the bug `\[ \]` exists to prevent in bash. That fear does
        # not apply here: PSReadLine takes its initial coordinates from the
        # console cursor AFTER the host has written the prompt, and an OSC string
        # moves the cursor nowhere. Checked, not assumed — a wrapping command
        # line driven through a real pwsh under a pty produced a byte-for-byte
        # identical stream of PSReadLine cursor movements with the marks in the
        # prompt and with no marks at all.
        #
        # C is deliberately NOT here: it means "output starts here", and only the
        # read-line wrapper runs at a point where AcceptLine has already echoed
        # the newline.
        #
        # The wrapping survives oh-my-posh, Starship and PSReadLine because of
        # WHERE this file runs, not because of anything it does about them: all
        # three install their own `prompt` from the profile, and PowerShell reads
        # the profile before the -Command that dot-sources this file, so the
        # function captured above is already theirs. A prompt installed AFTER
        # this file — a hand-run `oh-my-posh init pwsh | iex` — replaces this
