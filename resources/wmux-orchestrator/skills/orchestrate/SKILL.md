# wmux Orchestration Skill

You are the orchestrator. Your job is to decompose the user's task into parallel subtasks, create a wave-based execution plan, and launch Claude Code agents to execute it.

## Phase 0: Resolve Plugin Root

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set by Claude Code only inside hook execution, NOT in the main session's shell environment. You MUST resolve the plugin root path before running any scripts.

Run this to find and export the plugin root:

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT=$(find "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/wmux-orchestrator" -name "plugin.json" -path "*/.claude-plugin/*" 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's|/.claude-plugin/plugin.json||')
echo "PLUGIN_ROOT=$PLUGIN_ROOT"
ls "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/" | head -5
```

If the `find` returns empty, the plugin is not installed. Tell the user:
> "wmux-orchestrator plugin not found. Install it with: `claude plugins install wmux-orchestrator@wmux-orchestrator`"

**Store `PLUGIN_ROOT` and use it for ALL subsequent `bash` commands in this orchestration.** Every script reference below uses `$PLUGIN_ROOT` — you must prefix every bash command that references plugin scripts with the same export or pass the resolved path directly.

## Phase 1: Detect wmux

Run the detection script:

```bash
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/detect-wmux.sh"
```

Store the result as `WMUX_MODE`:
- If output is `"available"` → `WMUX_MODE=wmux` — agents spawn in visible terminal panes via `wmux agent spawn`
- If output is `"unavailable"` → `WMUX_MODE=degraded` — agents spawn as invisible Claude Code subagents via the Agent tool

**This decision is binding for the entire orchestration.** Do not switch modes mid-orchestration.

If degraded, log to the user:
> "wmux not detected. Running in degraded mode — agents will use Claude Code's native subagent system. Install wmux for the full multi-pane experience: https://wmux.org"

If wmux mode, log to the user:
> "wmux detected. Agents will spawn in visible terminal panes."

## Phase 2: Analyze the Codebase

Before decomposing, understand what the task involves:

1. **Map relevant files**: Use Glob and Grep to find all files related to the task
2. **Trace dependencies**: For each relevant file, check its imports and exports to understand coupling
3. **Identify conflict zones**: Files that would need to be touched by multiple subtasks — these MUST be assigned to a single agent or sequenced across waves
4. **Check git context**: Read recent commits for relevant context

Be thorough but efficient. You need enough understanding to make good decomposition decisions, not a complete codebase map.

## Phase 3: Decompose into Subtasks

Based on your analysis, break the task into subtasks. Each subtask must have:
- A clear, bounded scope described in 2-3 sentences
- An explicit list of files it may modify (allowed files)
- An explicit list of files it must NOT modify (other agents' zones)
- No circular dependencies with other subtasks

**Rules for decomposition:**
- Files that are tightly coupled (heavy imports between them) belong in the same subtask
- Shared types/interfaces should be in the earliest wave (other agents depend on them)
- Tests should generally be in the last wave (they depend on implementation)
- Prefer fewer, larger subtasks over many tiny ones — agent startup has overhead
- A single-line fix does NOT need an orchestration. If the task is trivial, just do it directly.

Reference the decomposition guide for patterns:
```bash
cat "$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/orchestrate/references/decomposition-guide.md"
```

## Phase 4: Build the Wave Plan

Organize subtasks into sequential waves based on dependencies:

- **Wave 1**: Foundation work — types, models, shared interfaces. No dependencies on other subtasks.
- **Wave 2+**: Work that depends on previous wave output. Agents within a wave run in parallel.
- **Final wave**: Tests, documentation, or anything that depends on all previous work.

Determine agent count per wave based on:
- Number of truly independent subtasks in that wave
- If wmux is available, check layout capacity: `wmux list-panes`
- Maximum practical limit: 5 agents per wave (more causes diminishing returns from context overhead)
- If only 1 subtask exists, skip orchestration and do it directly

## Phase 4.5: Detect Coupling & Generate Contracts

Before presenting the plan, audit each wave for **coupling**: cases where multiple parallel agents must agree on names, types, shapes, or IDs for the final output to work. Coupling that isn't explicitly coordinated causes drift — agents independently invent different names for the same concept and the integration breaks. (This actually happened on a past run: two parallel agents building HTML and CSS invented different class names like `.hero__grid` vs `.hero__inner` for the same element, and 510 lines of alias CSS were needed to reconcile after the fact.)

### Coupling triggers

A wave has coupled agents when any of these apply:
- Two or more agents touch files of the same domain that reference each other by name:
  - HTML + CSS of the same component (class names must match)
  - HTML + JS of the same component (mount-point IDs and selectors must match)
  - Frontend client + backend server for the same feature (endpoint paths, request/response shapes must match)
  - Schema producer + schema consumer (exported type signatures must match)
  - Multiple agents adding methods/fields to the same exported module
- Two or more agents fill slots in a shared top-level structure (e.g., one writes the HTML skeleton, others write the component markup that plugs into it)
- Two or more agents read from or write to a common config/constants file

### Resolution paths

For each coupled group, choose ONE resolution:

1. **Merge into a single agent.** Use when the coupled work is small enough for one agent (roughly < 800 lines of final output) AND the work is naturally cohesive. Prefer this when possible — fewest moving parts.

2. **Sequence across waves.** Move one agent to an earlier wave; the later wave's prompt includes the earlier wave's result file so the dependent agent reads real names from real files. Use when the coupling is directional (types → consumers, schema → migrations, API → clients) and large enough that merging would make one agent unwieldy.

3. **Generate a shared contract file.** Write a single source-of-truth document that BOTH agents read before writing any code. Use when the work MUST run in parallel AND the coupling is naming-only, not logic-level.

### Generating the contract file (path 3)

When you choose path 3, write `{orch-dir}/wave-{N}-contract.md` BEFORE spawning the wave. Every shared name must appear in it. If an agent needs a name not in the contract, that's a bug — the agent must stop and flag disagreement (see injection below), not silently invent.

Template (omit sections that don't apply — don't include placeholder text, only real names):

````markdown
# Wave {N} Contract — [short description]

> This is the single source of truth for names shared by parallel agents in wave {N}.
> All agents listed below MUST read this file before writing any code and use these
> names verbatim. Do not invent alternatives.

## Agents bound by this contract
- agent a ([role])
- agent b ([role])

## Shared HTML class names
_(fill this section when at least one agent writes HTML and another writes CSS)_
- Site header: `.site-header`, `.site-header__brand`, `.site-header__nav`, `.site-header__link`
- Hero: `.hero`, `.hero__grid`, `.hero__title`, `.hero__title__line`, `.hero__cta`

## Shared DOM IDs and mount points
_(fill when one agent writes HTML scaffolding that another agent fills via JS)_
- `#wave-sim-root` — empty div in hero; agent c mounts the simulator into it
- `aside.activity-rail` — empty aside in hero; agent e appends log lines to it

## Shared CSS custom properties
_(fill when CSS declares variables that JS reads/writes)_
- `--scroll` — 0..1 fractional page scroll, written by motion agent, read by CSS
- `--mouse-x`, `--mouse-y` — **pixel** values (not normalized), written by ambient agent, read by CSS `top`/`left`

## Shared TypeScript/JavaScript exports
_(fill when one agent declares types/functions used by another in the same wave)_
- `export type User = { id: string; email: string; role: 'admin' | 'user' }` in `src/shared/types.ts`
- `export function formatDate(d: Date): string` in `src/shared/format.ts`

## Shared API endpoints
_(fill when frontend and backend are coupled)_
- `POST /api/auth/login` — request `{ email, password }`, response `{ token, user: User }`
- `GET /api/users/:id` — response `User`

## Shared file structure
_(fill when multiple agents place files in a coordinated layout)_
- `src/components/Hero/Hero.tsx` — structure (agent a)
- `src/components/Hero/hero.module.css` — styles (agent b)
````

### Injecting the contract into agent prompts

For EVERY coupled agent in the wave, add this block to their prompt file (in Phase 6c), placed right after the `## Orchestration Context` section and before `## Your Zone of Work`:

````markdown
## Shared Contract — READ BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE

You share this wave with other agents who depend on the same names. To prevent naming drift, a shared contract has been written at:

`{orch-dir}/wave-{N}-contract.md`

**Before writing any code, use the Read tool to read that file in full.** It defines every class name, mount point, type, and API shape that you and the other agents must use identically. Use these names verbatim — do not invent alternatives, do not translate them, do not simplify them.

If a name in the contract seems wrong or missing:
1. Stop implementation.
2. Write to your result file with status `contract_disagreement`.
3. Describe the specific name at issue and your proposed alternative.
4. Do NOT silently invent a different name and proceed.

The reviewer will pick up any `contract_disagreement` result and reconcile before the next wave.
````

Agents NOT in a coupled group skip this block — their work is independent and doesn't need the extra read.

## Phase 5: Present the Plan

Show the user a structured plan. Format it clearly:

```
Orchestration Plan: [task description]
Agents: [total] in [N] waves
Estimated complexity: [low/medium/high]

Wave 1 — [description]
  Agent A: "[subtask label]"
    Allowed files: [list]
    Excluded files: [list]

Wave 2 (after Wave 1) — [description]
  Agent B: "[subtask label]"
    Allowed files: [list]
    Excluded files: [list]
  Agent C: "[subtask label]"
    Allowed files: [list]
    Excluded files: [list]

Wave 3 (after Wave 2) — [description]
  Agent D: "[subtask label]"
    Allowed files: [list]
    Excluded files: [list]

Options:
  --worktree: Isolate each agent in a git worktree (default: no)
  --no-review: Skip the automated reviewer (default: review enabled)
```

Ask the user: **"Validate this plan? (yes / adjust / cancel)"**

Wait for user approval. If they want adjustments, modify the plan and re-present. Do NOT proceed without explicit approval.

## Phase 6: Initialize Orchestration

Once the user validates:

### 6a. Generate orchestration ID

```bash
ORCH_ID="orch-$(date +%s | tail -c 7)"
echo $ORCH_ID
```

### 6b. Create orchestration directory and state file

**Windows/Git Bash: align `TMPDIR` with the wmux sidebar first.** The wmux sidebar cockpit watches
Node's `os.tmpdir()` (`C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Temp`), but in Git Bash `TMPDIR` is often unset,
so scripts fall back to `/tmp` — and the cockpit never sees the run. Export it before creating the
directory:

```bash
# Windows Git Bash only — point TMPDIR at the same temp dir the wmux app watches
export TMPDIR="$(cygpath "$LOCALAPPDATA")/Temp"
```

Create the directory:
```bash
mkdir -p "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/wmux-orch-$ORCH_ID"
```

Write `state.json` using the Write tool. Schema:
```json
{
  "id": "orch-XXXXXX",
  "task": "the user's task description",
  "status": "running",
  "startedAt": "ISO-8601 UTC timestamp",
  "cwd": "project working directory",
  "workspaceId": null,
  "dashboardSurfaceId": null,
  "useWorktrees": false,
  "waves": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "status": "running",
      "blockedBy": [],
      "agents": [
        {
          "id": "a",
          "label": "Subtask label",
          "subtask": "Full subtask description",
          "files": ["allowed/file/paths"],
          "excludeFiles": ["excluded/patterns/*"],
          "paneId": null,
          "surfaceId": null,
          "status": "pending",
          "exitCode": null,
          "toolUses": 0,
          "resultFile": "<orch-dir>/agent-a-result.md",
          "startedAt": null,
          "finishedAt": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "reviewer": {
    "status": "pending",
    "agentId": null,
    "reportFile": "<orch-dir>/review-report.md"
  }
}
```

**Use BARE agent IDs: `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` — NOT `"agent-a"`.** Every script builds file paths by
prefixing `agent-` to the id (`spawn-agents.sh` looks for `agent-<id>-prompt.md`,
`collect-results.sh` for `agent-<id>-result.md`). With `"id": "a"` everything lines up as
`agent-a-prompt.md` / `agent-a-result.md`. With `"id": "agent-a"` the scripts look for
double-prefixed `agent-agent-a-prompt.md` — the launcher can't find the prompt, the pane silently
drops to a bare shell, and result collection misses the files.

**Use forward-slash paths in `state.json`** (`"cwd": "C:/projects/app"`, not `C:\projects\app`).
Backslashes written through a bash heredoc collapse into invalid JSON escapes (`\p`), every reader
fails to parse the file, and the sidebar silently freezes at 0/N.

Set the first wave's status to "running", all others to "pending".

### 6c. Generate agent prompt files

For EACH agent, create a prompt file at `{orch-dir}/agent-{id}-prompt.md` — with the bare ids from
6b this is `agent-a-prompt.md`, `agent-b-prompt.md`, etc., exactly what `spawn-agents.sh` looks for:

```markdown
# Mission: [subtask label]

## Orchestration Context
You are [Agent ID] in orchestration [ORCH_ID].
[N] other agents are working on the same project in parallel.
You are in Wave [N] of [total waves].

[If this agent is in a coupled group per Phase 4.5, inject the Shared Contract block here — see Phase 4.5 template. Skip for non-coupled agents.]

[If wave 2+:]
## Previous Wave Results
The following agents completed before you. Their results:
[Paste contents of previous agents' result files here]

## Your Zone of Work
Allowed files (you MAY modify these):
- [list each file]

Excluded files (you MUST NOT modify these):
- [list patterns]

## Your Mission
[Detailed subtask description with specific steps]

## When You Finish
Create your result file at: [orch-dir]/agent-[id]-result.md

Use this format:
### Summary
[2-3 sentences]
### Files Modified
- `path` — [description]
### Interfaces/Types Changed
[Any exported types that changed signature]
### Tests
[Test results or "Out of scope"]
### Risks
[Points of attention for other agents or reviewer]
```

If an agent's mission involves driving the wmux **browser panel** (web testing, SPA interaction,
form filling) — or puts any CDP client on a port, such as a chrome-devtools MCP — append the
contents of `$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/orchestrate/references/browser-driving.md` to its prompt. It
documents the CLI's sharp edges (eval scoping, ref format, framework-specific input recipes) and
the one that bites agents who never meant to touch the panel: **wmux owns `9222`**, and a second
CDP client there hangs at `Runtime.enable` while `/json/list` and the panel report different pages.

### 6d. Create wmux layout (if available)

**IMPORTANT: Work in the CURRENT workspace. Do NOT create or close workspaces — that hides agent panes from the user.**

The spawn script (`spawn-agents.sh`) automatically creates panes via `wmux layout grid` (one atomic split-tree mutation for the whole wave).

**Pane hygiene — start each orchestration from a single coordinator pane.** Re-gridding a window
that already has extra panes (a previous run's agents, stray splits) does NOT reuse them: the old
panes' surfaces get orphaned as dead tabs on the coordinator pane. If leftover agent panes exist
from a previous wave or run, close them first (`wmux close-pane <paneId>` — positional id, and never
the coordinator's own pane).

### 6e. Spawn Wave 1 agents

**CRITICAL RULE: When wmux is available, you MUST use `wmux agent spawn` to create agents in visible terminal panes. Do NOT use Claude Code's `Agent` tool when wmux is available — the Agent tool creates invisible subagents that the user cannot see. The `Agent` tool is ONLY for degraded mode (no wmux).**

**If wmux IS available:**

Spawn agents using the spawn script:
```bash
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/spawn-agents.sh" "[orch-dir]" 0
```

This script:
1. Creates a pane per agent via `wmux layout grid --count <agents+1>` (orchestrator keeps the anchor cell)
2. Runs `node launch-agent.js <prompt-file>` in each pane via `wmux agent spawn --replace-tab`, so the agent TUI replaces the grid pane's default terminal tab (agent panes end with a single tab)
3. `launch-agent.js` uses `execFileSync` with `'--'` separator to pass the full prompt as a positional argument — this bypasses all shell quoting issues
4. Claude starts in **interactive mode with full TUI** — the prompt auto-submits and Claude begins working immediately
5. The user can watch agents in real-time by clicking their pane tabs, and can type into any agent to intervene

After spawning, verify agents are running:
```bash
wmux agent list
```

You should see agents with `"status": "running"`.

**If wmux is NOT available (degraded mode only):**

Spawn each agent using Claude Code's native Agent tool:
- For each agent in Wave 1, use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "wmux-orchestrator:wmux-worker"`
- Pass the prompt file content as the prompt
- Use `description: "[agent label]"` for tracking
- Wait for all agents to complete before proceeding to next wave

## Phase 7: Monitor and Transition (Orchestrator Loop)

**You are the orchestrator.** Your job is to monitor agent progress and coordinate wave transitions. This is where the real orchestration happens.

### Live dashboard visibility

Before entering the loop, note how the user sees progress:

- **In wmux mode**: wmux's sidebar automatically watches `{TMPDIR}/wmux-orch-*/state.json` and renders a live cockpit (task, elapsed time, per-wave progress bars, per-agent state dots, tool counts). `state.json` on disk is the ONLY channel to the cockpit — the app polls it every second (by mtime) and nothing pushes. Tool-use counts update via hooks running inside each agent's session, but **agent completion and wave/run transitions are YOUR job to write** (see the monitoring loop below). Do NOT call the text dashboard manually in wmux mode; it would be redundant and noisy.

- **In degraded mode (no wmux)**: you must print the text dashboard into Claude Code's conversation at each wave transition so the user can see progress. Run:
  ```bash
  node "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/dashboard-text.js" "[orch-dir]"
  ```
  Call it ONCE after spawning each wave, and ONCE after each wave completes. Do not call it inside the monitoring loop (that would spam the session). If the user asks "how's it going", you can also call it then.

### With wmux (poll-based monitoring):

**The completion signal is the RESULT FILE, not process exit.** `launch-agent.js` runs each agent's
Claude **interactively** (full TUI, no `-p`), so a finished agent idles at its prompt and never
exits — `wmux agent list` reports `"running"` forever. A loop that waits for `"exited"` never
terminates. Poll for the result files instead:

After spawning Wave N agents, enter a monitoring loop. Poll every 15-20 seconds for each agent's
result file:

```bash
ls "[orch-dir]"/agent-*-result.md 2>/dev/null
```

An agent is done when `[orch-dir]/agent-<id>-result.md` exists. (`wmux agent list` is still useful
to confirm agents *spawned* and to get their `agentId`/`surfaceId` — just not for completion.)

**While agents are working, report status to the user:**
- Tell the user which agents are still working and which have finished
- Example: "Wave 1: Agent a (HTML+CSS) still working, Agent b (i18n) finished (result file written)"

**You own state.json.** Claude Code's Stop/SubagentStop hooks do NOT fire for wmux-spawned agents —
they are independent processes, not subagents of your session — so nothing updates `state.json`
automatically. As agents finish, update it yourself using the state helpers, **with the status
vocabulary the sidebar actually counts** (`exited` for agents, `complete` for waves/run — NOT
`completed`, which the sidebar ignores and leaves the cockpit stuck at 0/N):

```bash
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/orchestration-state.sh"
NOW=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
update_agent "[orch-dir]" "<id>" "status=exited" "exitCode=0" "finishedAt=$NOW"
# when the whole wave is done:
update_state "[orch-dir]" ".waves[N].status" complete
```

(Windows note: reads of `state.json` can race the app's 1-second poller — a read may intermittently
fail even though the file exists. Retry short reads a few times, and prefer one atomic final write
over many rapid updates.)

**When ALL agents in the current wave have written their result files:**

1. Read each agent's result file:
   ```
   [orch-dir]/agent-[id]-result.md
   ```
2. Report results to the user: which agents succeeded, which failed, what they produced
3. Mark the wave `complete` in state.json (see above), then **reap the idle agent TUIs**:
   `wmux agent kill <agentId>` for each finished agent (ids from `wmux agent list`), and close their
   panes (`wmux close-pane <paneId>`) so the next wave starts from a clean layout.
   ⚠ `agent kill` does NOT kill processes the agent started (dev servers, watchers) — if agents
   launched servers, sweep the project's ports for orphaned listeners before starting new ones.
4. If there are more waves:
   a. Generate prompt files for Wave N+1 (inject previous wave results into the "Previous Wave Results" section)
   b. Spawn Wave N+1 agents: `bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/spawn-agents.sh" "[orch-dir]" [N+1]`
   c. Verify agents spawned with `wmux agent list`
   d. Continue monitoring loop
5. If all waves are done, mark the run `complete` (`update_state "[orch-dir]" ".status" complete`)
   and proceed to Phase 8

**Nudging a running worker:** `wmux send` / `send-key` target the **caller's own surface** by
default — without `--surface` the text lands in YOUR session as fake input, not the worker's. To
redirect a worker mid-flight: write the instruction to a file, then
`wmux send --surface <workerSurfaceId> "read and follow <file>"` and
`wmux send-key Enter --surface <workerSurfaceId>` (surface ids are in state.json after spawn, or
`wmux agent list`). Verify delivery by its effects (result file, file changes) — `read-screen` may
be unavailable in some builds.

### Without wmux (degraded mode — Agent tool returns):
1. Wait for all Wave N agents to complete (their Agent tool calls return)
2. Read their result files
3. Generate Wave N+1 agent prompts (inject previous wave results)
4. Spawn Wave N+1 agents using Agent tool
5. Repeat until all waves complete

## Phase 8: Launch Reviewer

When all waves are complete:

1. Aggregate results:
```bash
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/collect-results.sh" "[orch-dir]"
```

2. Invoke the reviewer skill to analyze all changes and produce a final report.

## Phase 9: Finalize

After the reviewer completes, present a summary:
- Total time elapsed
- Agents used, waves completed
- Files modified (from `git diff --stat`)
- Test results (if reviewer ran tests)
- Reviewer findings and corrections
- Offer actions: **commit** / **view full diff** / **abort all changes**

Then **collapse the layout back to a single coordinator pane**: `wmux agent kill <agentId>` any
agents still idling, `wmux close-pane <paneId>` their panes, and sweep for orphaned child processes
(dev servers the agents started survive `agent kill` and can hold ports hostage for the next run).
A clean single-pane state is what makes the next orchestration's grid come up without orphaned tabs.

To abort a botched run and clear the cockpit: `update_state "[orch-dir]" ".status" aborted` — the
sidebar only tracks the most recent *running* orchestration.
