 * anywhere in wmux, which is the one question a user running several agents
 * actually has.
 *
 * This module is the missing aggregate. It is deliberately pure and free of
 * React and Zustand: the precedence rules and the pruning below are the part
 * worth testing, exactly as workspace-status.ts is kept beside its component.
 *
 * It reads ONLY declared state (issue #128) — never a heuristic. A pane whose

 * idle. Adding a screen-detection source later means adding a field here, not
