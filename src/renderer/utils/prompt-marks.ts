/**
 * The terminal-side half of the prompt log (issue #207): xterm markers,
 * decorations, and the buffer reads that turn a boundary into text.
 *
 * Kept out of the store on purpose. An `IMarker` is a live emulator object with
 * an identity and a disposal contract — it is not serialisable, it must not be
 * compared by value, and holding one past its terminal's disposal is a crash
 * waiting for the next render. So the store holds the FACTS about a prompt
 * (text, ordinal, timestamp, resolved line) and this module holds the objects,
 * keyed by surface exactly like `surfaceMouseModes` and `surfaceTerminalRegistry`.
 *
 * Two properties of xterm markers do the bookkeeping for us and are the reason
 * this file is as small as it is:
 *
 *   • A marker disposes ITSELF when its line is trimmed out of the scrollback,
 *     and `marker.line` reports -1 once that has happened. So an entry that has
 *     scrolled out of history stops being jumpable without anyone pruning it.
 *   • A decoration is owned by its marker, so disposing the marker disposes the
 *     highlight with it. There is no separate highlight lifetime to get wrong.
 *
 * The one thing markers do NOT survive is the serialize/replay a split-tree
 * restructure performs (`snapshotSurfaceBuffer` → `terminal.write(snapshot)`,
 * issue #49): the replacement terminal has the same TEXT but none of the marker
 * objects. That is handled by forgetting the surface's marks on unmount and
 * letting every entry fall back to `line: null` — the outline still lists the
 * prompts, it just cannot jump to the ones from before the restructure. Faking
 * a line there would scroll the user somewhere arbitrary, which is worse than
 * an honestly disabled jump.

/**
 * Tint the prompt's rows and draw a rail down their left edge (idea 1).
 *
 * ─── Why the tint is a decoration OPTION and not a CSS rule ──────────────────
 *
 * It used to be CSS: a `::before` on the decoration's DOM element at `opacity:
 * .12`, with `layer: 'bottom'` believed to put it under the glyphs. It does not,
 * and cannot. xterm gives its decoration container `z-index: 6` while the
 * renderer's canvas is `z-index: 2`, so a DOM decoration ALWAYS paints over the
 * text; `layer` only orders decorations against each other. The 0.12 was there
 * to stop the tint washing out the text it sat on — and at 0.12 over a terminal
 * background every hue collapses to the same near-neutral grey. Users reported
 * exactly that: "the rail is always the default grey, whatever colour I pick."
 * The colour was being applied perfectly; it just could not be seen.
 *
 * So the tint is handed to the RENDERER instead, via `backgroundColor`, which
 * both the WebGL and DOM renderers composite into the cell background before
 * drawing glyphs on top. That is the layer the CSS was only pretending to be on,
 * and being genuinely underneath is what lets the tint be strong enough to carry
 * a hue while the text stays crisp.
 *
 * The rail stays in CSS, where it is the one thing showing the user's colour at
 * full saturation, and the custom property still carries it so `prompt-marks.css`
 * owns the width.
 *
 * ─── Why the tint is checked against the row's CONTENT (issue #230) ──────────
 *
 * A marker anchors a decoration to a buffer LINE, and for a shell that is the
 * same thing as anchoring it to content: the row a command was typed on is
 * never rewritten again. An agent TUI breaks that equivalence. It repaints its
 * input box and its status row over the same lines several times a second, and
 * the submit-time cursor — the only line wmux has when the `UserPromptSubmit`
 * hook arrives — sits right inside that region. `refineMark` gets out of it by
 * finding the row the prompt was echoed on, but it can MISS: a prompt shorter
 * than `MIN_NEEDLE`, or one the TUI reflowed beyond recognition, leaves the
 * mark where it started. Nothing then re-checked it, so the band went on
 * tinting a row whose text had since become `✳ Germinating… (1m 15s)`.
 *
 * So the tint is a claim about content and is treated as one, twice:
 *
 *   • before registering — a band that would be wrong is never painted, rather
 *     than painted and retracted a frame later;
 *   • on every render — `onRender` fires when the row is laid out, and only
 *     then, so a decoration in scrollback costs nothing and a visible one is
 *     re-checked exactly as often as it is seen. That is the difference between
 *     this and a timer, which is what issue #141 is a standing warning against.
 *
 * A failed check drops the tint and the rail, keeping the ruler tick: the mark
 * is still roughly where the prompt is (which is what a tick claims), it is
 * just no longer on the row (which is what a band claims).
