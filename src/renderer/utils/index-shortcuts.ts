// ─── Numeric index shortcuts (issue #202) — pure ─────────────────────────────
// `Ctrl+1…9` (select workspace N) and `Ctrl+Alt+1…9` (select tab N) used to be
// two hardcoded keydown listeners with no way to rebind or turn them off. The
// source comment gave the reason: nine remappable ShortcutAction entries each
// would have added ~18 rows to Settings for what is really ONE decision per
// family — "which modifiers carry the digit row, if any".
//
// So this is not a ShortcutAction. It is a modifier *mode* per family, which
// buys everything the issue asked for (remap, swap the two, disable either one)
// in two Settings rows instead of eighteen.
//
// DOM-free on purpose (cf. shortcut-binding.ts) so the node-environment Vitest
// suite can exercise the matcher without jsdom.

 * Which modifiers must be held for the digit row to act as an index jump.
 * `'off'` disables that family entirely — the third option the issue asked for,
