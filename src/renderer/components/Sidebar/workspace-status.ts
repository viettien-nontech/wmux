/**
 * Fold the roster's counts into the signals this module already arbitrated on.
 *
 * Issue #235 was the sidebar answering one question from two sets of facts: the
 * roster banner read `rollupAgents` (declared state AND screen detection) while
 * the workspace row read only the hook/observer-derived sessions. An agent
 * reached through ssh + tmux reports no hooks back to this machine, so its
 * screen was detected as working while the row beside it said "Idle".
 *
 * The fix is to give both the same inputs. What it must NOT do is rank the
 * rollup as a priority level of its own above the rest of the chain, which
 * breaks two things at once:
 *
 *  - The older signals answer a FINER question than the rollup does. "Reading
 *    file…" says more than "Running…", so a rollup ranked above the tool label
 *    throws information away every time it agrees with it.
 *  - `unknown` is the case the declared-state protocol exists for (issue #128):
 *    it means "an agent is here and has not said what it is doing", so it must
 *    fall THROUGH to the heuristics, never over them. As its own level it put
 *    the literal word "Unknown" on a row whose shell knew perfectly well that
 *    it was running, and dropped that row's state dot entirely.
 *
 * So each roster count joins the existing signal it is evidence for, and the
 * priority chain below is left exactly as it was. `unknown` contributes to no
 * count and therefore changes nothing — absence of a claim is not a claim.
