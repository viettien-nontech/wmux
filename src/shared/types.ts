   * agent-browser engine control for ONE browser surface (renderer → main).
   *
   * Distinct from the `browser.*`/CDP channels above, which run a verb against
   * whichever engine a surface already has: these change WHICH engine it has,
   * plus the install flow that makes `agent` reachable at all. The renderer
   * cannot do any of it itself — the binary, the session registry and the
   * dashboard refcount all live in main.
   *
   * `CURRENT_URL` and `OPEN` are the two exceptions to that framing, and they
   * exist because the pane's address bar was lying. In agent mode the bar can
   * only show the last URL the PANE asked for, while the agent navigates the
   * real Chrome independently — so the two drift and the bar reports a page
   * nobody is on. `CURRENT_URL` reads where the session actually is.
   * `OPEN` is its counterpart: the pane used to reuse `ENABLE` to mean
   * "navigate", which re-acquired the dashboard and re-bound the stream on
   * every address-bar Enter.
