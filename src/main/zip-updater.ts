// ── Portable zip in-place update ────────────────────────────────────────────
// wmux's README install is "extract the win-x64 zip anywhere and run
// wmux.exe". That layout has no NSIS uninstaller, so electron-updater's
// NsisUpdater cannot replace it: a zip listed in latest.yml downloads and
// then quitAndInstall() no-ops (issue #96, endless "update ready" loop),
// and a setup.exe listed there would install a *second* copy under
// %LOCALAPPDATA% while leaving the zip extract untouched.
//
// This path is the in-app equivalent of a user downloading the zip, killing
// wmux, and copying over the folder. It is user-initiated only — there is
// no unattended download. The titlebar badge / Help button click is the
// consent; the same confirmation dialog as the NSIS path still fires
// before the swap.
//
// Apply cannot overwrite a running wmux.exe, so after the zip is extracted
// we write a tiny cmd helper, detach it, and quit. The helper waits for
// this PID to exit, robocopies the payload over the install root, and
// relaunches.
//
// That helper is VISIBLE, and it says what it is. `detached: true` implies
// DETACHED_PROCESS, and Windows ignores CREATE_NO_WINDOW next to it, so the
// `windowsHide: true` on the spawn below buys nothing: cmd.exe allocates a
// console of its own (measured — a detached spawn adds a conhost.exe, an
// otherwise identical non-detached one does not). A user reported the result
// as an empty console titled `findstr.exe /I /C:" <pid> "`, with no way to
// tell whether it wanted input or wanted closing. Hiding it is the wrong fix
// twice over: dropping `detached` risks the helper dying with wmux, which is
// the one failure the user cannot recover from (wmux has already quit), and a
// hidden detached script that overwrites an unsigned exe and relaunches it is
// the dropper shape #3 is about. So the window states its purpose instead.
//
// The helper does NOT strip Mark of the Web, and that step must not be
// reintroduced (#3).
// There is nothing to strip: net.request + createWriteStream write no
// :Zone.Identifier stream, so neither the zip nor its extracted payload has
// one, and executables under the install dir are already unblocked in-process
// by stripMotw() in index.ts on every launch. A hidden PowerShell recursively
// running Unblock-File is, on the other hand, a MOTW-bypass pattern (MITRE
// T1553.005) and the strongest behavioural-AV signal the helper used to emit.
//
// No extra runtime downloads (no curl, no npm unzip, no Invoke-WebRequest):
//   download — Electron net.request (Chromium). Always present in a packaged build.
//   extract  — %SystemRoot%\System32\tar.exe (Windows 10 1803+, which Electron 43
//              already requires), then Windows PowerShell Expand-Archive.
//   apply    — cmd.exe + robocopy/tasklist/waitfor/findstr, all via System32.

 * Hands the swap to the detached helper and quits — but only once the helper

 * quitting, because a quit whose helper never runs leaves the user with no
 * wmux and nothing to restart it (#3):
 *
 *   - the payload is gone (Storage Sense, a temp cleanup, days after "Later"):
 *     rejects with code PAYLOAD_MISSING, and only a fresh download can help;
 *   - the helper cannot be written, or cmd.exe fails to start (an antivirus
 *     blocking either): rejects with that error, and the payload is still good.
 *
 * The 'error' listener stays attached after 'spawn', so a late error on the
 * child is a no-op rather than an uncaught exception in main.
