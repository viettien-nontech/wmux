/**
 * Consent gate for everything wmux writes outside its own directory (issue #132).
 *
 * wmux integrates with Claude Code, OpenCode, Kiro, omp and pi by editing files
 * in the user's home: it appends a block to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md,
 * ~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md, ~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md and pi's user-scope
 * context file, writes ~/.kiro/steering/wmux.md, registers eight hook families
 * in ~/.claude/settings.json, installs a status extension into
 * ~/.pi/agent/extensions/, points chrome-devtools-mcp at its own CDP proxy, and
 * installs an OpenCode orchestrator plugin.
 *
 * It also used to install a Claude Code plugin, which is deprecated and gone
 * (issue #239). Its uninstall is not: see `removeOrchestratorPlugin`.
 *
 * All of that used to happen unconditionally on every launch, with no prompt and
 * no record of a decision — so deleting any of it was futile, because the next
 * launch simply put it back. As #132 put it, the app modifies global config
 * "without permission and/or warning". Idempotence and consent pull in opposite
 * directions, and the code only implemented the first.
 *
 * The fix is a decision stored in wmux's OWN settings file (%APPDATA%\wmux),
 * never in the files being written:
 *
 *   unset     nothing has been written yet; ask on first launch
 *   granted   apply the features that are switched on
 *   declined  write nothing, and take back anything a previous version wrote
 *
 * `declined` is deliberately sticky and re-asserted on every launch: a user who
 * says no once should not have to say it again after an update, and should not
 * have to hand-delete the leftovers either.
