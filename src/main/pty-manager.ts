 * sidebar's dots are waiting for.
 *
 * The precedent is three functions below: `shellEnv.hasWsl` is already cached
 * "because it shells out to `where`, and this runs on every pane create". That
 * reasoning was always true of the user's own shell too; only wsl.exe got the
 * cache.
 *
 * Negative results are cached as well, deliberately. A miss is the *expensive*
 * branch (two probes, and `where` scans the whole PATH before failing), and it
 * is what a user with an uninstalled or mistyped shell hits on every pane. The
 * cost is that installing a shell mid-session will not be noticed until wmux
 * restarts — which is exactly how `cachedDefaultShell` and `cachedWsl` already
 * behave, so this adds no new surprise.
 *
 * A cached *hit* is re-validated with a cheap `existsSync` before being handed
 * back, so an exe that is uninstalled or moved while wmux runs re-probes
 * instead of feeding a dead path to `pty.spawn` — which would surface as node-
 * pty's opaque "File not found: ".
