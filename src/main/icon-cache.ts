/**
 * The Windows shell icon cache, and wmux's stale-icon story (issues #137, #226).
 *
 * wmux installs to the same path on every update, and Explorer caches shell
 * icons per path in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\iconcache_*.db.
 * After an update that changed the artwork, the taskbar button, a pinned
 * shortcut and the Start-menu entry keep drawing the icon of the version they
 * replaced, while the app's own window icon and its notifications — loaded
 * from disk at runtime — are already correct. #137 and #226 are that split,
 * reported twice by the same person across two rebrands.
 *
 * Nothing an installer can do fixes it, and 1.5.1 measured that: `ie4uinit`
 * in both spellings left every cache file untouched, and
 * `SHChangeNotify(SHCNE_ASSOCCHANGED)` reaches Explorer windows and the Start
 * menu but NOT a pinned taskbar button, whose bitmap lives in the taskband
 * store keyed on the AppUserModelId (see build/installer.nsh). The cache
 * databases are memory-mapped by the running explorer.exe and flushed only when
 * it exits, so the one thing that works is restarting Explorer with the files
 * deleted in between. An installer must not do that silently — but the user
 * can ask for it, from a button that says exactly what it costs.
 *
 * Two pieces:
 *
 * 1. `iconNoticeDue` — did the shipped icon change since this machine last ran
 *    wmux? Decided from a fingerprint of the .ico stored under wmux's own
 *    APPDATA dir, so the user is told ONCE, after the update that changed it,
 *    that the taskbar may lag and where the button is. Reading a bug report
 *    two rebrands apart is the alternative.
 *
 * 2. `refreshShellIconCache` — the Explorer restart, behind a native confirm
 *    in ipc-handlers.ts. Absolute System32 paths throughout: a writeable PATH
 *    dir must not get to shadow `taskkill.exe` for a command wmux runs on the
 *    user's behalf (the rule `win32-process.ts` and `system32.ts` already
 *    state).
