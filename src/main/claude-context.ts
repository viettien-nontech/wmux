/**
 * The bundled wmux-orchestrator plugin, DEPRECATED in 2.12.0 (issue #239).
 *
 * wmux used to copy `resources/wmux-orchestrator/` into Claude Code's plugin
 * cache and hand-write `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` to register
 * it. That never worked, and #239 is the careful report of why: the file uses a
 * v2 schema — `{ version: 2, plugins: { "<plugin>@<marketplace>": [ … ] } }` —
 * and wmux wrote its entry at the TOP LEVEL, as an object rather than an array,
 * under a cache layout (`cache/<plugin>/<version>`) that is not Claude's
 * (`cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>`) either. Claude Code therefore never
 * listed the plugin, never loaded its skills or commands, and marked the copied
 * tree `.orphaned_at` for garbage collection — while `enabledPlugins` said
 * `true` and wmux logged a successful install.
 *
 * The obvious repair is to ship a real local marketplace and register through a
 * supported path, and that is the right fix for a plugin worth keeping. This one
 * is not: parallel agent orchestration is now something Claude Code does itself,
 * far better than a shell-script wave planner driving panes from the outside.
 * So the plugin is retired rather than re-plumbed, and wmux writes NOTHING into
 * Claude Code's plugin machinery any more.
 *
 * What remains is the inverse, below. Deprecating a feature that spent releases
 * writing into someone else's config is not "stop writing" — it is "stop
 * writing, and take back what was written", the same rule #132 set for every
 * other integration. Anyone who still wants the orchestrator can install it as
 * a normal plugin from github.com/amirlehmam/wmux-orchestrator; wmux's sidebar
 * orchestration panel keeps reading its state file either way.
