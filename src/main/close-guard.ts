/**
 * Close-window guard (issue #227): "ask before the red × takes every session
 * down with it".
 *
 * The workspace guard (#90, `confirmWorkspaceClose`) protects one session from
 * a stray click on the sidebar ×. Nothing protected the WINDOW: the caption's
 * × — or Alt+F4, or a mis-aimed click on a machine so loaded the pointer barely
 * moves, which is how #227 was reported — ends every PTY in it at once, and the
 * agents in them with it. Opt-in, like #90: most people quit wmux by closing
 * the window and must not be asked every time.
 *
 * This module is the DECISION only. The effect — `event.preventDefault()` and
 * a native `dialog.showMessageBox` — lives in `window-manager.ts`, because a
 * BrowserWindow `close` event needs a real Electron app to reach, and the part
 * worth pinning is which of three things happens to a close request.
 *
 * Why a native dialog rather than the renderer's ConfirmCloseDialog: the close
 * has already been requested in MAIN by the time anyone can intervene, and the
 * renderer may be exactly the thing that is unresponsive (the reporter's
 * machine was "at its limit"). A main-process modal needs nothing from the
 * page to appear, and nothing from the page to answer.
