/**
 * v2-browser.ts — Per-caller browser routing for V2 pipe handlers (issue #62).
 *
 * Each distinct caller (an agent's terminal surface, identified by its
 * WMUX_SURFACE_ID and sent as `params.caller`) is bound to its OWN browser
 * surface, created in that caller's workspace. The CDPBridge tracks every
 * attached browser independently, so concurrent agents no longer share — and
 * clobber — a single browser window. With no caller (manual human use) we fall
 * back to the legacy shared browser.
 *
 * ── Two engines, one set of verbs ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * A browser surface is backed either by the Electron <webview> (`web`, the
 * default and the only thing that existed before) or by vercel-labs
 * agent-browser driving a real Chrome (`agent`). The engine is a property of
 * the SURFACE, resolved here — never of the command. That is the whole design
 * goal: the global CLAUDE.md wmux writes to every machine keeps saying
 * `wmux browser open <url>`, so no agent anywhere has to be re-educated, and
 * only what happens underneath changes. Consequently the two engines must be
 * indistinguishable to a caller in everything it can observe — verb names,
 * result shapes, and the error for a verb neither supports.
