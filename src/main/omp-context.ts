/**
 * omp (Oh My Pi) integration (issue #165).
 *
 * The fourth agent wmux teaches about itself, after Claude Code, OpenCode and
 * Kiro. It is a Windows-native terminal coding agent, which makes it a closer
 * fit for wmux than most — the request in #165 was from a team that is "100%
 * omp on Windows 11" and read wmux as Claude-only.
 *
 * ── Where the block goes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * omp's `native` discovery provider reads `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md` at USER
 * scope, for every session, and native files have the highest discovery
 * priority of any provider. That is the one global, per-user location, so it is
 * where the block belongs.
 *
 * Worth being explicit about a tempting shortcut that was rejected: omp also
 * ships `claude` and `agents-md` discovery providers, so on many machines it
 * would already pick up the block wmux writes to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and appear
 * to work with no code at all. That is not something to rely on — it is true
 * only while the user has Claude Code installed AND has not put `claude` in
 * `disabledProviders`, and it makes wmux's behaviour on an omp-only machine
 * depend on a competing tool being present. Writing the native file means omp
 * support does not quietly evaporate when someone uninstalls Claude Code.
 *
 * ── Why a whole file rather than a splice ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same reasoning as kiro-context.ts, for a different reason. Kiro reads every
 * file in a steering directory, so wmux can own one. Here the file is a single
 * shared AGENTS.md that the user may well have written in — so the block is
 * spliced between markers exactly as it is for Claude Code and OpenCode, and
 * everything outside the markers is left alone.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT installed ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No hooks. omp has a genuinely good hook surface — `session_start`,
 * `turn_start`/`turn_end`, `agent_start`/`agent_end` and pre/post tool events
 * map onto wmux's declared-state protocol almost one for one — but it discovers
 * them from `.omp/hooks/` *inside a project*, walking up from cwd. There is no
 * global hook directory, so wiring the sidebar that way would mean writing into
 * every repository the user opens. That is precisely the complaint in #132, and
 * the Kiro decision applies unchanged: a status indicator is not worth it.
 *
 * omp reports state the same way any agent can without a plugin — the
 * instructions block documents `wmux report-agent`, and the declared-state
 * protocol (#128) takes it from there. An omp extension that does this
 * automatically is the right shape for a follow-up, since extensions CAN be
 * configured globally; it is a separate piece of work from teaching omp that
 * wmux exists.
 *
 * That follow-up landed for pi rather than for omp — see pi-context.ts and
 * resources/pi-extension/wmux.js (#231). pi auto-discovers extensions from
 * `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` globally, which is exactly the property this
 * paragraph is asking for; omp still lacks a global equivalent, so it still
 * gets no hooks.
