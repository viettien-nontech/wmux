 * ## Why the block needs it (issue #158)
 *
 * The block loads GLOBALLY, so it reaches sessions wmux did not spawn — the
 * Claude Code desktop app, a plain terminal, an SSH session, a scheduled run,
 * anything that was already open before wmux started. wmux only ever puts
 * `wmux` on PATH for PTYs it spawns itself (pty-manager prepends the shim dirs
 * to that process's environment; nothing is persisted to the user's PATH). So
 * for most of the population the block is written for, `wmux` is NOT on PATH.
 *
 * That made the probe ambiguous in the one direction that matters. The block
 * told the reader that "command not found, no reply, or an error" all mean wmux
 * is absent — but "command not found" says nothing about whether wmux is
 * running, only that this session cannot reach the CLI. Every agent on a
 * machine with a perfectly healthy wmux concluded it was gone.
 *
 * ## Why interpolating a path here is sound, when #152 wasn't
 *
 * #152 removed an assertion because it was a write-time fact read at an
 * arbitrarily later time, and nothing at generation time could make it true.
 * This is the opposite shape: the writer is the installed build, it is writing
 * its OWN location, and it rewrites the block on every startup. It therefore
 * self-heals across exactly the failure that produced the report — an update
 * that relocated the install from %LOCALAPPDATA% to Program Files and left a
 * hand-added PATH entry dangling.

 * (Claude Code's CLAUDE.md, OpenCode's AGENTS.md, omp's AGENTS.md, and whichever
 * of pi's candidate names pi will actually read — see pi-context.ts). Kiro is
 * the exception: it gets a file of wmux's own, so it has nothing to splice.
 *
 * `trimEnd()` on the block is load-bearing and not cosmetic. The block ends
 * with a newline and so does the text following the old END_MARKER, so keeping
 * both appends one blank line to the file on EVERY launch — unbounded growth in
 * a file the agent loads into context each session. Trimming the block lets the
 * tail supply the newline exactly once, which is what makes re-splicing a
 * fixed point.
 *
 * Lives here rather than being duplicated per agent because it was duplicated
 * per agent, and the copies had already diverged on precisely that line.
