# wmux config file

wmux reads `~/.wmux/config.toml` on startup (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.wmux\config.toml`).
The file is optional — if it isn't present, built-in defaults apply.

Edit it, then run `wmux reload-config` (or restart wmux) to pick up changes.

## Full example

```toml
[terminal]
font-family      = "Cascadia Mono"
font-size        = 14
cursor-style     = "block"        # block | underline | bar
cursor-blink     = true
scrollback-lines = 10000

[terminal.colors]
# Default scheme for every new pane. Any bundled theme name works
# (see `wmux list-themes`), or the key of a user-defined scheme below.
default = "Dracula"

# User-defined named schemes — override individual fields of the base theme.
# Invoke them with:   wmux split --color-scheme prod
[terminal.colors.schemes.prod]
background = "#2b0b0b"
foreground = "#ffdddd"
cursor     = "#ff5555"

[terminal.colors.schemes.staging]
background = "#2b1f0b"
foreground = "#ffeecc"
cursor     = "#ffaa44"

[terminal.colors.schemes.dev]
background = "#0b1f0b"
foreground = "#ccffcc"
cursor     = "#55ff55"

# Full palette override (up to 16 ANSI colors) — optional.
[terminal.colors.schemes.mono]
background = "#000000"
foreground = "#ffffff"
palette = [
  "#000000", "#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#ffff00",
  "#0000ff", "#ff00ff", "#00ffff", "#ffffff",
  "#555555", "#ff5555", "#55ff55", "#ffff55",
  "#5555ff", "#ff55ff", "#55ffff", "#ffffff",
]

[workspace]
# What a NEW workspace opens with — the sidebar "+", Ctrl+N, first launch and
# `wmux new-workspace` all use this.
panes  = 3         # 1-8 terminal panes
layout = "grid"    # grid | columns | rows | left | down | single
# Snapshot the live layout this often, as an "Auto-save …" session. 0 = never.
snapshot-minutes = 5

[browser]
# Start page for a workspace's browser panel. Needs a scheme.
default-url = "http://localhost:3000"
# Extra ports that count as dev servers, merged with the built-in list.
dev-ports = [8501, 4321]
auto-open = true

[remote]
# In a direct SSH pane, SCP local files before inserting their remote paths.
upload-on-paste = true
upload-on-drop  = true

[keys]
# Remap what a key sends to the terminal (see "Key remaps" below).
"ctrl+k"       = "<C-k><Delete>"   # kill to end of line, then pull the next line up
"ctrl+alt+r"   = "clear<CR>"
"ctrl+shift+q" = ""                # empty value = swallow the key
```

## New workspace shape

`[workspace]` decides what a fresh workspace opens with. Every entry point reads
it — the sidebar `+`, Ctrl+N, first launch, and `wmux new-workspace`:

```toml
[workspace]
panes  = 3
layout = "grid"
```

| `layout`  | Arrangement |
|-----------|-------------|
| `grid`    | Balanced rows. At 3 panes this is wmux's classic T: two across the top, one below. **Default.** |
| `columns` | All side by side. |
| `rows`    | All stacked. |
| `left`    | One full-height pane on the left, the rest stacked to its right. |
| `down`    | One full-width pane on top, the rest side by side below. |
| `single`  | Shorthand for `panes = 1`. |

`panes` accepts 1 to 8; anything outside that is clamped, and `wmux config show`
says so. Before 2.8.0 the sidebar `+` always made three panes and
`wmux new-workspace` always made one — both now follow this setting, and
`wmux new-workspace --panes 1 --layout single` pins the old CLI shape for a
script that depends on it.

## Session snapshots

`snapshot-minutes` (Settings → Workspace → *Snapshot sessions every*) decides how
often wmux saves the live layout as a named session. `0` switches it off; the
default is every 5 minutes.

```toml
[workspace]
snapshot-minutes = 5
```

wmux already rewrites `session.json` every 30 seconds, but in place — so it only
ever holds the layout you have *now*, which is no help at all once something has
gone wrong. Snapshots land under **Load session** as `Auto-save <date> <time>`,
and restore like any other saved session (layout only; PTYs respawn).

Two properties worth knowing (issue #238):

- **Three are kept, not one.** A single overwritten entry bounds recovery to
  the state a few minutes ago — which, after an accident, is the state *after*
  it. Three slots stay out of the way and keep some depth behind the mistake.
- **Only a layout that actually changed uses a slot.** Workspaces, their titles
  and their split trees count; a shell changing directory does not. So an idle
  machine never rotates its own history out of the ring.

Snapshots never become the session restored on your next launch — that pointer
only ever follows a Save you asked for.

A **saved layout marked Default** (Settings → Workspace → Saved Layouts) wins
over this section: it also carries each pane's shell, directory and startup
commands, so it answers the same question more completely. Any other saved
layout is one click away from the caret next to the sidebar `+`.

A workspace created from a **saved layout** — picked from that menu or the
command palette, or made from the Default layout — is named after the layout
with an instance number: `Work-1`, then `Work-2`, and so on. The number is one
past the highest `Work-N` currently open; a plain `Work` does not count.

Any other new workspace with no title of its own is **named after the tabs it
opens with**, in pane order: `api + api + notes.md + Prompts`. A terminal is named
after its starting directory, else its shell; a markdown or code tab after its
file; a tab with a custom title after that. The title is set once, at creation,
and renamed like any other. When no tab has a name of its own — the plain
`Terminal + Terminal + Terminal` of the shape above with no directory or shell —
the workspace is called `Workspace N` instead. An explicit title always wins:
`wmux new-workspace --title`, **Open folder as workspace**, and a restored
session keep theirs.

## Browser start page

```toml
[browser]
default-url = "http://localhost:3000"
```

Where a workspace's browser panel opens before it has been anywhere. A scheme is
required — a bare `localhost:3000` is refused with an explanation, because a
webview handed one loads nothing and says nothing. Leave it empty (or omit it)
for wmux's own page. This is the start page, and is separate from the default
search engine, which decides where a typed non-URL goes.

## Remote file upload

The optional `[remote]` section controls local files pasted or dropped into a
pane connected directly over SSH:

```toml
[remote]
upload-on-paste = true
upload-on-drop  = true
```

Both values default to `true`. `upload-on-paste` covers a screenshot or copied
file inserted with either paste shortcut; ordinary clipboard text is never
uploaded. `upload-on-drop` covers one or more files dropped onto the terminal.
Hold Shift while dropping to bypass upload for that drop.

wmux invokes the Windows OpenSSH `scp` paired with the detected `ssh` client and
uses `BatchMode=yes`. The connection must therefore authenticate without an
interactive password or passphrase prompt, normally with a key or `ssh-agent`.
Each successful file is inserted as a unique path in a private remote batch
directory, such as `/tmp/wmux-drop-<batch-id>/<file-id>.png`, and remains there
for the receiving program to use.

Detection covers `wmux ssh` and a direct `ssh` launched from an integrated
PowerShell or Bash pane. Nested SSH (running a second `ssh` after reaching the
first host) is not supported because that second client is outside the Windows
process tree. wmux may still identify the outer Windows SSH process, so turn the
relevant setting off (or hold Shift for a drop) while working on the inner host.

Run `wmux reload-config` after changing either value.

## Key remaps

`[keys]` maps a key chord to the bytes wmux should send to the program running in
the terminal. Each entry is `"chord" = "sequence"`.

```toml
[keys]
"ctrl+k" = "<C-k><Delete>"
```

**Chords** are written `ctrl+shift+alt+key` (any subset, any order), or in the
vim style `<C-k>` / `<C-S-Tab>`. `alt` and `meta` both mean Alt.

**Sequences** are sent as typed, with `<...>` naming a key:

| Token | Sends | Token | Sends |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<CR>` / `<Enter>` | Enter | `<Up>` `<Down>` `<Left>` `<Right>` | arrow keys |
| `<Esc>` | Escape | `<Home>` `<End>` | Home / End |
| `<Tab>` / `<S-Tab>` | Tab / Shift+Tab | `<PgUp>` `<PgDn>` | Page Up / Down |
| `<BS>` | Backspace | `<Ins>` | Insert |
| `<Delete>` / `<Del>` | Delete | `<F1>`…`<F12>` | function keys |
| `<C-x>` | Ctrl+x control byte | `<Space>` | space |
| `<A-x>` / `<M-x>` | Alt+x (ESC prefix) | `<lt>` | a literal `<` |

Anything outside `<...>` is sent literally, so `"clear<CR>"` types the word and
presses Enter. An empty value (`""`) swallows the key.

Notes:

- Remaps apply **inside terminal panes only**, and they take priority over
  wmux's own shortcuts there — remapping `ctrl+t` means Ctrl+T no longer opens a
  tab while a terminal has focus.
- Modifiers match exactly: a `ctrl+k` remap does not fire on Ctrl+Shift+K.
- A binding that doesn't parse is reported by `wmux config show` and skipped;
  the rest of your bindings still apply.
- `wmux reload-config` applies edits live, including removing bindings.

## UI translations

wmux ships English, Français, Español, Deutsch, Português, Italiano,
Nederlands, Polski, Türkçe, Русский, Українська, 中文, 日本語, 한국어, हिन्दी,
Svenska and Čeština. You can add a language, or correct a shipped one,
without waiting for a
release: drop a JSON file into `~/.wmux/locales/`, next to `config.toml`.

```
~/.wmux/locales/
  tt.json      # adds Татарча to Settings → General → Interface language
  ko.json      # overrides individual bundled Korean strings
```

The filename is the language code. The file is a key → string map, optionally
wrapped in `strings` with a `label` for the dropdown:

```json
{
  "label": "Татарча",
  "strings": {
    "settings.title": "Көйләүләр",
    "markdown.copy": "Күчерү"
  }
}
```

A flat map without `label`/`strings` works too, in which case the code is used
as the dropdown name.

**How it merges.** A file whose code matches a bundled language overrides only
the keys it lists — you can fix one string without restating the rest. A file
with a new code adds a language, falling back to English for anything it does
not translate. Removing the file and reloading undoes it; the file is the whole
state.

The full key list is the English dictionary, which is the source of truth:
[`src/renderer/i18n/locales/en.ts`](../src/renderer/i18n/locales/en.ts).
Placeholders like `{count}` and `{name}` must survive verbatim — they are
substituted by the UI, so a renamed or dropped token silently breaks the string.

```bash
wmux locales          # what loaded, and why any file was rejected
wmux locales path     # print ~/.wmux/locales
wmux locales reload    # re-read and apply live (same as `wmux reload-config`)
```

Notes and limits:

- Codes must be **base tags** (`de`, not `de-AT`). Language auto-detection
  collapses the OS locale to its base tag, so a region-subtagged file would
  define a language that could never be selected automatically.
- Keys that are not in the English dictionary are ignored, and `wmux locales`
  reports how many — that is usually a typo or a key removed by a later release.
- A malformed file costs you that file only; the rest of the directory and every
  bundled language still load.
- Once you select a user-defined language it survives restarts. If you later
  delete the file, wmux falls back to your OS language rather than showing raw
  keys.
- Translations are welcome upstream too — a PR adding
  `src/renderer/i18n/locales/xx.ts` makes it a bundled language for everyone.

## Precedence

1. Built-in defaults
2. Settings UI values (persisted to Zustand / localStorage)
3. **`config.toml`** — applied over 1 and 2 at startup and on `reload-config`
4. Per-pane overrides (e.g. `wmux split --color-scheme prod`) — always win for that pane

"File wins at startup, app wins at runtime": if you tweak a value in the Settings
UI after wmux booted, your tweak sticks until the next reload.

## CLI helpers

```bash
wmux config path      # print the config file path
wmux config show      # dump the parsed config (useful for debugging syntax)
wmux config reload    # re-read the file and apply to running surfaces
wmux reload-config    # alias of `config reload`
wmux list-themes      # print all valid `default`/`--color-scheme` names
wmux locales          # list community translations and any load errors
```

## Notes

- Keys can be written either `kebab-case` or `camelCase`
  (`font-family` and `fontFamily` both work).
- `cursor` inside a scheme is the cursor color; use `cursor-style` (under `[terminal]`)
  for the shape.
- A parse error in one key is reported in `wmux config show` but never
  aborts loading — the rest of the file still applies.
- Per-pane overrides via `wmux split --color-scheme NAME` or
  `wmux set-color-scheme [id] NAME` always take precedence for that surface.
